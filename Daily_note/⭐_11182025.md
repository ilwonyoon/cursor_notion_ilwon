# Ohouse AI: Near-term Implementation Strategy
## Discovery Conversation - Room Photo to Personalized Commerce

---

## 2. Core Idea: From Room Photo to Actionable Commerce

You’re not building “another e-commerce onboarding” that just collects basic info and drops users into a generic product grid.

The **core difference** you want to highlight:

> You take *three things* —
>
> 1. the user’s pain point,
> 2. their goal, and
> 3. the most critical context, **the actual photo of their room** —
>    and turn that into **actionable, personalized commerce**.

Instead of asking users to browse irrelevant inspiration and then guess how to map it to their own space, you:

1. Start from **their real room**.
2. Understand **what they want to change** and **what they’re shopping for**.
3. Generate a **curated “shopping home” for that specific space**, not a generic feed.

This is the near-term pitch: a concrete, shippable flow that already expresses the bigger AI interior agent vision.

## 3. UX Flow: Onboarding → Shopping Home → Deep Exploration

### 3.1 Onboarding: Collecting Context + Pain Points

First part: onboarding.

* The user **uploads a photo** (or video) of their space.

  * Example: just-moved-in living room, basic furniture only, feels empty.
* During analysis time, you **collect structured intent**:

  * What room / space is this?
  * What is their **goal** for this space?
  * Which **product categories** they care about?
* The idea is: **user context (room photo) + pain points + goals** → strong recommendation.

You explicitly say you’re **not** trying to support complex “multi-room” cases right away. You *could*, but you intentionally keep the initial v1 constant and focused so the narrative and UX stay clean.

### 3.2 Shopping Home (“Shopping Haul”) for *Your* Space

After onboarding, the user lands on a **curated shopping home for their space**:

* It’s **anchored to their photo + room type** (e.g. “Your Living Room”).
* They’ve already:

  * Uploaded a photo,
  * Picked categories,
  * Stated their goal and space.

Now they see:

* A **curated product list** that fits their context.
* Some products **pre-rendered into their room** (DALL·E / image model).

  * Not every item is pre-rendered, to manage token cost and latency.
  * But enough to give them a **visual hit** of “this is what it would look like in *my* room.”

Once they tap a product:

* They go to the **PDP / product review page**.
* There, they can:

  * Request to place that product in their room,
  * See **not only that item but similar recommended products** rendered in context.
* From there, they can:

  * Open a **media viewer**,
  * View it in **3D**,
  * Jump into a **3D environment (room planner-like)** where they can move, tweak, and refine,
  * Potentially generate **multiple 4K images** and alternate views.

You emphasize that this is a **2D ↔ 3D loop**:

* Users can switch between rendered photos and 3D manipulation,
* Without worrying about complex in-app editors, because many scenes are **pre-rendered**.

You see this as a **very strong prototype**: users can bounce between inspiration, visualization, and decision with minimal friction.

---

## 4. Room Planner / “Loop Generator”: Why Dimensions Matter

You point out a critical constraint:

* Interior products are fundamentally about **dimensions**.
* AI image models can’t reliably infer **exact measurements**.
* So, if dimensional accuracy is off, the rendering might look okay but **not be trustworthy**.

That’s why you see the **3D room planner / loop generator** as essential:

* It can create dimensionally accurate scenes.
* It may take longer, but it gives users **confidence that items will actually fit**.
* The future flow is:

  * Use AI for **fast, inspirational visuals**,
  * Use the room planner / 3D environment for **precision and final validation**.

This dual-layer (fast AI → precise 3D) is part of your strategic story.

---

## 5. Style Transfer & Data: From Inspiration Photos to My Room

You then shift to **style transfer as data**:

* Ohouse (and the internet) already has tons of **inspiration content**.
* The problem: users see beautiful rooms but **don’t know how to map them to their own space**.

Your approach:

1. Let users **collect inspiration images** they like.
2. The system creates a **detailed “style transcript”** from those photos.
3. That transcript is then **translated into their own room**:

   * Users don’t need to know design vocabulary.
   * They just pick photos they like; delete what they don’t.
   * The system compresses this into a **single, structured representation** of style.

Who this helps:

* People who **don’t plan a full renovation** but want to decorate more confidently.
* People who **are renovating**:

  * They can see where their “designable style” is heading,
  * They can reduce miscommunication with contractors / designers by showing “this is what I want” in a structured way.

This is not just about generating pretty pictures; it’s about turning inspiration into **structured, reusable data** that drives both design and communication.

## 6. User Pain Points, Value, and Business Impact

You explicitly want **one slide** that captures:

1. **User pain point** (simple sentence)
2. **User value**
3. **Business impact**

### 6.1 User Pain Points

From your own words:

* Users have a real room and a vision but **no clear, personalized path** from that to shopping decisions.
* They spend a lot of time browsing inspiration that **doesn’t match their actual space**.
* Even when they find great designs, they often **lack emotional confidence** to pursue them:

  * Because interior investments are **meaningful (5k–100k)**,
  * They’re not sure if “this style is really for me.”

### 6.2 User Value

The value you’re delivering:

* You turn **their actual space** into a **tailored, actionable shopping experience**.
* You **reduce time to discovery**:

  * Recommendations are based on **their view of the world**, not generic images.
* You help them **discover products they didn’t even know they wanted**, but that still fit their room and style.
* You eventually support:

  * Creation and iteration of multiple designs,
  * Style transfer from inspiration → their own space,
  * 2D ↔ 3D validation.

### 6.3 Business Impact & Metrics

You define two key metrics:

1. **Time to discovery**

   * How quickly users find relevant products for their room.
2. **Discovery to conversion**

   * How efficiently users move from “I see it in my room” → purchase.

Your broader thesis:

* **Less time in the app, better conversion**:

  * Faster, more relevant discovery → higher trust → higher conversion.

Early signal you mention:

* For users who click on **rendered product suggestions**:

  * You’ve seen ~**50% conversion** on those items (even with very small sample size).
  * This is based on a **tiny catalog subset (~40 SKUs) out of millions**, but:

    * It’s a strong directional signal that when users can see **real products in their real space**, conversion can be very high.
* You’re clear that:

  * You **don’t have “bulletproof” metrics yet**,
  * But you do have **promising early evidence** to justify further investment.

---

## 7. Strategic Shift: From Consumption → Creation → Conversion

You articulate what you see as the **biggest shift** in the Ohouse experience:

* Today:

  * People **browse inspiration** that often doesn’t match their reality.
* Future (near-term vision):

  * People **create their own interior designs** for their real rooms,
  * With the help of **AI agents and tools** you build in.

You describe this as:

> Moving from **consumption-to-conversion**
> to **creation-to-conversion**.

This also mirrors the broader AI trend:

* People don’t just search for information;
* They **wait for AI to generate something tailored to their needs**.

Your AI chat + onboarding:

* Is basically the **DALL·E product offering baked into the Ohouse experience**.
* Users don’t have to go to a search results page or scroll to the bottom of a listing.
* The AI becomes **“your interior designer”** within the app.

---

## 8. Agent Architecture: Why This Isn’t Just “Another AI Chatbot”

You’re explicit: anyone can now build an AI chatbot if they have API keys. That’s not your differentiator.

What matters to you:

* **How you break down user requests** into:

  * Clear intents,
  * Structured tasks,
  * Agent-specific instructions.
* How quickly and reliably you can **get the job done** with high-quality results.

You describe:

* An initial consultation that:

  * Categorizes user **intent**,
  * Captures **goals**,
  * Routes the user to the **right agent** (visualization, style, structure, etc.).
* A system where users can:

  * **Review** what the AI proposes,
  * **Modify** and iterate,
  * Optionally **start directly** with a specific agent if they know what they need.
* Behind this, a **flowchart / engine**:

  * Simple UI elements on top,
  * Complex orchestration of agents under the hood,
  * The point is: **simple in front, powerful and well-designed behind**.

You also want to communicate that:

* The **UI will likely look simple** (like ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity).
* But what matters — and what differentiates your work — is:

  * The **quality and relevance of the results**,
  * The **depth of domain understanding**,
  * Your prior knowledge of Ohouse users and their behavior.

You want a memorable way to say:

> This is not a generic AI experience anyone can build.
> We have **deep expertise**,
> we know our users,
> and we’re structurally set up to **build this successfully**.

---

## 9. Trust, Credibility, and Social Validation

You surface an important user insight:

* People often like a design but **don’t feel emotionally confident** enough to commit.
* On Reddit and similar communities:

  * They use generative AI,
  * But still ask: “Do you like option A/B/C?”
* They’re seeking **social proof** and **reassurance**, not just tools.

You note:

* Ohouse AI, as an AI interior designer, **doesn’t yet have a portfolio or track record**.
* Trust **cannot be produced instantly**.
* You need a strategy to **earn credibility over time**.

One concept you’re considering:

* A **freemium model** where:

  * Users can earn extra credits by **voting on which design they like more**.
  * This:

    * Trains the models (similar to how other gen-AI services collect preference data),
    * Creates a **job to be done** for free users (they contribute feedback),
    * Builds social validation for other users.

You’re unsure whether to include this in the main deck or save it for:

* **Part 2**: Challenges, questions from leadership, and your answers,
* Or **Q&A** discussion.

But you are certain that:

* You **need to talk about credibility** as part of the design journey:

  * How you’ll earn trust step-by-step,
  * How you’ll borrow the patterns of human interior designers and community feedback,
  * So this doesn’t feel like “a random AI interior designer some startup made,”
  * But like a **trusted, evolving expert**.

## 10. Near-Term vs Long-Term: Why Start Here

Finally, you frame why this near-term prototype and integration matter:

* **Near-term**:

  * Integrate Ohouse AI into the current experience,
  * Shift from inspiration-browsing to **creation-driven journeys**,
  * Build multiple specialized agents (visualization, style, structure),
  * Test, learn, and build confidence in this direction.

* **Long-term**:

  * You’re not claiming this is “magic from day one.”
  * You know there’s a lot to polish:

    * Model efficiency,
    * RAP / ranking models,
    * Better product recommendation engines.
  * This phase gives you:

    * Time and data to **improve the underlying AI engines**,
    * Real-world feedback to shape the final experience,
    * A credible pathway from **today’s Ohouse** to a **true AI interior agent**.

If you want next, I can turn this into:

* A **single slide** (pain point / value / business impact),
* Or a **2–3 slide portfolio segment** that reads cleanly without your narration.
