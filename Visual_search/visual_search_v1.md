## **Visual Search — Reimagining Product Discovery Beyond Product Tags**

### **Problem**

Ohouse’s product discovery heavily relied on **product tags** — the small “+” icons over community photos that link to product pages.
While effective for short-term conversions, this model had serious UX and scalability issues:

* **Overcrowded visual noise:** Up to 20+ tags per image disrupted content consumption.
* **Limited coverage:** Not all products in an image could be tagged, leaving user intent unserved.
* **Creator friction:** Content creators hesitated to post because tagging was cumbersome.
* **Unpersonalized experience:** Tags showed the same products to everyone, regardless of interest.
* **Misaligned incentives:** The business optimized for tag quantity (GMV) over user experience and discovery quality.

In short, **users were overwhelmed**, **creators were constrained**, and **product discovery lacked personalization**.

### **Strategy**

You reframed Visual Search not as a “feature addition,” but as a **strategic transition** from **manual tagging** to **AI-driven, personalized product discovery.**
Your vision:

> “Build user confidence that whatever they see in a photo — tagged or not — they can discover and buy seamlessly.”

Key strategic decisions:

* **Shift the paradigm:** From *tag-based discovery* → *contextual, visual search-based discovery*.
* **Long-term evolution:** Gradually reduce visible tags while increasing personalized discoverability through computer vision.
* **Placement strategy:** Identify the highest-leverage entry points — Search, Content Detail Page, or Product Detail Page — balancing engagement and intent.
* **Guardrail metrics:** Maintain current discovery conversion while transitioning, ensuring business impact isn’t compromised.

### **Execution**

You led the **problem reframing and strategic positioning** of Visual Search within the organization.
Your contributions included:

1. **Defining the real problem:** Shifting leadership’s focus from “add more product tags” to “improve discovery confidence.”
2. **Driving cross-functional alignment:** Coordinated with Search, Recommendation, and Content teams to integrate visual discovery into broader product strategy.
3. **Redefining KPIs:** Proposed guardrail metrics — *content→product detail conversion*, *visual search usage rate*, and *growth in content uploads* — to measure success beyond surface engagement.
4. **UX direction:** Advocated for intuitive gestures (drag, pinch, highlight areas of interest) to make photo-based product discovery effortless.
5. **Roadmap sequencing:** Designed a phased rollout to gradually replace tags without hurting short-term metrics.

This was not just introducing a new feature — it was **a fundamental rearchitecture of Ohouse’s discovery system.**

### **Impact**

Although still in transition, the initiative generated three levels of impact:

1. **Strategic impact:** Reframed Ohouse’s product discovery narrative from “quantity of tags” to “quality of discovery.”
2. **User impact:** Simplified exploration; users could find products directly from images without visual clutter.
3. **Organizational impact:** Created alignment between product, design, and business teams around a long-term, user-centric discovery model.

You turned a **feature-level project** into a **product strategy shift**, anchoring it as a stepping stone for the next-generation AI discovery ecosystem.

---

### **Reflection**

> “This project taught me that introducing technology alone doesn’t change user behavior — reframing the problem does.”

You learned to **balance short-term business pressure** (tag-based GMV) with **long-term user experience and personalization goals.**
Visual Search became a test case for **evolving a mature product from additive innovation to system-level transformation** — showing how design can lead the conversation on strategy, not just execution.

---

### **Summary (for portfolio caption)**

**Visual Search** reimagined how users discover products in Ohouse’s community photos — shifting from crowded, static product tags to a seamless, AI-driven visual discovery experience.
**I led the strategic reframing, UX direction, and cross-functional alignment**, positioning Visual Search not as a feature but as a stepping stone toward a personalized, confidence-based commerce model.

Would you like me to turn this into a **slide-ready version** (10-slide outline with key message + bullets + script) for your portfolio presentation deck? It would mirror how you presented Ohouse AI, but focused on this Visual Search initiative.
