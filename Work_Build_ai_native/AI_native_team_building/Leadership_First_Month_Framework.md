## The First Month: Building Credibility by Doing the Work

When I take over a team or organization, I don't start with vision.
I start with **understanding the customer.**

In my first month, I do three things:

**1. Map the product reality**: What value are we actually delivering?
   To whom? And where's the friction?

**2. Do the work myself**: Not to show off. But to understand why
   the team struggles. What are the real constraints? What takes time?

**3. Design for what's real, not what's ideal**: Only after this
   do I ask: "What would happen if we worked like AI-native here?"

### Why This Matters

Leaders who skip this step design systems for a product they don't understand.

I've seen it: beautiful frameworks bolted onto products that don't fit.
When you don't know your customer, when you haven't done the work,
your "system redesign" becomes another thing the team has to retrofit.

That's why I start with delivery. Not transformation.
Once I understand what we're really building for,
*then* I redesign how we build it.

## Core Leadership Principles (From Experience)

1. **Customer first, then systems** - Understand the value chain before redesigning process
2. **Do the work before leading it** - IC experience builds credibility and empathy
3. **System-level thinking from day one** - Partial changes create debt faster than progress
4. **Self-doubt is a feature, not a bug** - "Can I do this?" leads to better empathy with team
5. **Long-term over fast wins** - Phase 1, 2, 3, 4 approach rather than overnight transformation

## Where This Came From

- **UX Writing at Ohouse**: Went from 1 writer → 100+ users through system design
- **Design Systems management**: Learned that partial updates cost more than full redesigns
- **AI-native transformation**: Struggled with retrofitting AI into old processes, learned system redesign was necessary
- **Self-discovery**: Realizing leaders must do the work themselves to understand constraints

## For Future Use

- **Portfolio interviews**: "Tell me about your leadership philosophy"
- **Case study depth**: When explaining why you made certain decisions
- **Role discussions**: When asked "What would you do in your first month?"
