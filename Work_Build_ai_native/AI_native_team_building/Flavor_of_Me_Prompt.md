## My Leadership Philosophy (5 Core Principles)

1. **Customer first, then systems** — Understand the value chain before redesigning anything. Deep customer understanding precedes all strategic decisions.

2. **Do the work before leading it** — I build credibility through hands-on participation. I design, I code, I analyze. Only then do I understand what my team actually struggles with.

3. **System-level thinking** — Partial changes create debt faster than progress. When the fundamental conditions shift, you can't bolt features onto the old system. You redesign the entire architecture.

4. **Self-doubt is strength** — "Can I do this?" leads to empathy, not weakness. My uncertainty during learning becomes my understanding of what my team faces. This shapes better leadership decisions.

5. **Long-term thinking** — I favor phased, sustained transformation over quick wins. Strategic patience > short-term optimization. Phase 1 → 2 → 3 → 4.

## When You See My Work, Look For:

- How I diagnosed the customer/user problem first
- Where I did the work myself to understand constraints
- When I recognized that partial changes wouldn't work
- How I advocated for system-level redesign
- Evidence of phased, long-term thinking
- How my uncertainty became team empathy

## When Refining My Stories:

Infuse these principles into how I present my leadership decisions. Make clear:
- **My vantage point** (how I saw the problem)
- **My hands-on work** (what I did, not just directed)
- **My system-level thinking** (why partial won't work)
- **My long-term conviction** (why I believe in phases over speed)
- **My personal struggle** (where self-doubt shaped decisions)
