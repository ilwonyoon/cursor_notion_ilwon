## Core Prompt

I'm a design leader transitioning to AI product design IC. Here's my leadership philosophy—use it to shape how I tell my story:

### **1. Customer Understanding First**
I don't start with vision or strategy. I start by deeply understanding the customer/user problem and the organizational reality. Only after mapping what's actually happening—not what should happen—do I design solutions. This means I do the work myself first: I understand constraints, friction, and what takes time. Beautiful frameworks that ignore customer reality just become more debt.

### **2. System-Level Thinking, Not Quick Fixes**
When a system needs to change, partial updates cost more than full redesigns. I learned this managing design systems—incremental changes scatter maintenance burden across the team and create legacy debt faster than progress. When the fundamental medium or environment shifts (like AI changing how people work), you can't bolt features onto the old system. You have to redesign the entire architecture. This applies to product, org, and team workflows.

### **3. Leaders Must Do the Work Themselves**
I don't direct from a distance. I do the work first—design, write copy, debug workflows, understand the tools—so I know what my team is actually struggling with. Self-doubt during learning isn't weakness; it becomes shared empathy. "Can I really do this?" is how I understand why my team hesitates, what blockers are real, and how to design them away. Credibility comes from hands-on participation, not directive authority.

### **4. Long-Term Transformation Over Fast Wins**
I favor phased approaches (Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 3 → Phase 4) over overnight pivots. Sustainable change takes time. I'm willing to invest months in foundation-building if it means the system works right later. This patience isn't caution—it's strategic.

### **5. Capability Distribution > Headcount Scaling**
One person empowered with the right infrastructure can achieve outcomes that previously required a full team. I've proven this: one UX writer → 100+ users through system design. The goal isn't to hire more people; it's to architect systems that multiply individual impact. This requires understanding the domain deeply, building the infrastructure, and distributing capability deliberately.

## What This Means When Telling My Story

When I present a project or case study, look for these themes:

- **I started by understanding the user/customer problem, not jumping to the solution**
- **I did the work myself to build credibility and empathy**
- **I recognized when partial changes wouldn't work—I advocated for system-level redesign**
- **I got buy-in for long-term, phased approaches over quick wins**
- **I designed for capability distribution, not headcount expansion**
- **My personal conviction and self-doubt during learning shaped my leadership decisions**

## For Slide Decks / Pitch Narratives

When shaping how I present my work:

1. **Make my vantage point clear**: How did I see the problem? What customer conversations led me here?
2. **Show my decision-making process**: What alternatives did I consider? Who disagreed? How did I get buy-in?
3. **Highlight system thinking**: Where did I recognize that partial changes wouldn't work? What full redesign did I advocate for?
4. **Emphasize long-term thinking**: What made me confident this would work? How am I measuring success over time?
5. **Surface capability distribution**: How did I multiply impact without scaling headcount? What infrastructure made it possible?
6. **Include the struggle**: Where was I uncertain? How did that uncertainty become empathy for my team?

## Key Phrases / Language to Use

- "I started by understanding..."
- "I did the work myself to..."
- "I recognized this required system-level change because..."
- "Rather than hiring more, we built infrastructure to..."
- "I was uncertain about X, which taught me..."
- "The long-term play here was..."
- "My vantage point as [role] gave me visibility into..."

---

## What NOT to Emphasize

- Creative direction or design aesthetics (that's not leadership)
- Quick wins or short-term metrics without context
- Directive leadership or "telling people what to do"
- Status reports—focus on decisions and thinking
- Headcount growth or resource accumulation
- Partial, incremental improvements without system redesign

## Example Application

**Bad (without Flavor of Me):**
"I led the UX writing system. We built Claude Skills and it scaled the team output."

**Good (with Flavor of Me):**
"I recognized that one UX writer couldn't scale without changing the system itself. I started by understanding the bottleneck—it wasn't talent, it was infrastructure. So I architected Claude Skills + a phased adoption strategy. The result: one person set vision, but 100+ users had capability. This taught me that sustainable scaling isn't about headcount; it's about system design."
