So AI is here, AI work, AI native, the work like AI native is already here, but my team is not, my org is not, or my company is not, and I'm giving all resources, I give the free AI subscription, I built a team to support, and also I try to just like talk about it all times, that like, oh, if you're not gonna use the AIs, you're not gonna survive, and we're looking for AI native feature, we are hiring the AI, we are highlighting AI champions.”

You said:
“So you do everything you need, you think that you need to do, but at the same time, it's not like becoming the AI native at all. Why?”
00:11
You said:
“This is an intro part because I'm pretty sure a lot of people are facing the same issues.”
00:05
You said:
“So what I'm going to talk about is you give all the resources, but there's still one thing missing. Time. Time and the investment. And also, whether this workflow is pretty much embedded, like implemented into the entire org, not just the teams.”
00:20
You said:
“It's like a machine. It's like the machines, but some of the parts are automated, some other parts are not.”
00:07
You said:
“How Efficient is the Base?”
00:01
You said:
“So, I think I got a good metaphor, so...”
00:03
You said:
“Tesla versus other EV companies, which doesn't have the main computer control the car, which is good enough. But at the same time, it's not as efficient as the Tesla, which has the control tower. And control tower knows everything which is assigned to the job. But at the same time, the other companies, the traditional car companies, are trying to automate, the implementing the more advanced features into the small parts. And that's how you're gonna, that's how I compare.”
00:35
You said:
“And, I mean, I'm just going to talk, I mean, I thought about, I have a very organized way to talk about it, but let me just get into it. So, you give all the tools and resources and the emphases and the performance reviews, but at the same time it's not as moving fast as I want it to be. And I'm talking about the product design, but I am pretty sure it's scalable to the other. Why it happens. You have to understand the users, which is your team, and why they're not motivated.”
00:35
You said:
“So let me, starting from the team, the team member perspective. So I heard a lot of buzzword about the AI. I look into it. I look at the YouTube and people say, oh, it's there. It's changing pretty much every day. So I'm not going to touch on it. I mean, I can perform as much as I, I perform at my best strengths and I don't necessarily plan on tapping into it. And once things are settling in, that's the time I'm going to work on it. And if I'm looking, if I look at the evaluation, the performance review stuff, they're not really structured. They're just pushing it because they are urgent. So I'm not into it. And also I have some, and some other folks like, oh, I really wanted to try out. Oh, well, fuck. It takes time and it doesn't work. So I'm going to just go, oh, what if I'm wasting such a time and I'm not meeting the deadline? So I'm not meeting the deadline. So I don't know whether the time spent on here, the time spent on AI is things that are scalable. And the other team members who are like going through all the challenges that the other two folks went through and they're talking like, oh, I know I am thinking like, thinking like, and working like a native and I showcasing this is.”
01:29
You said:
“Thank you.”
00:03
You said:
“Oh, so how many team members I was mentioning? Three? Two?”
00:04
You said:
“So the third one I think you're missing out at the last part is that third one now very excited about the AI and he is very empowered, he feels very empowered and he wanted to kind of promote this type of work to the org as much as possible. The reality is that the number one and number two are kind of the same thing, just like watching that, oh, you're the YouTuber, good luck for it. Because I know they're talking about stuff, but the metrics are pretty much the same. You're saying that you're working faster, but is it winning or not? It's probably the same, right? So the third one is likely to be the one that's kind of leading the shepherd, leading the herb, the yangmuri, but if they're not really, if the org is not really catching up to the speed of how they work, they're going to be disappointed because they wanted to talk to work with someone like himself.”
01:18
You said:
“I mean, we might have more stereotypes of why people are not really adopting AI in the way you want it. And the last piece is you, the leader, who are promoting, setting the expectation, and asking, I mean, begging for, let's try to use it to innovate. But at the reality, how much time do you spend playing with the AI, actually building stuff, and how much do you know about the depths of the knowledge? Have you ever used a cloud code? Have you ever wished about something? Have you ever made a PR? Do you know anything about this one? I know this is not your deal with jobs. It used to be. I mean, this is not meant to be like, oh, I'm litter. So I am the leader, and I'm not the one who are executing it. I'm the one giving the direction. I'm the one giving the direction and setting the expectation, setting the objective. But, sorry, that's for the old days.”
01:09
You said:
“Think about how you become a leader, because you were excellent I see. Which means that you can drive the vehicle, let's say that it's the team, you are pretty much the driving the vehicle without any of the oversees. Now you're teaching somebody else how to drive, and at the end you're letting the street of the driver drive the street of the car. But things haven't changed. The vehicle you drove is not the vehicle you drive right now. So if you're not knowing what's happening, if you're not knowing how to drive the current vehicle, I mean you still are a leader. I'm not saying that you're gonna do all the nitty-gritty little details about all the eyes and words, but if you are a vehicle, it's changing. If you are driving a different type of vehicle, you need to learn how to actually play with it. You have to actually immerse yourself into it, so you get into the shoes of how these people think, and why people are hesitated, and what things could work, what things not. Otherwise you're going to waste such a the traditional way of you saying what to do, what's the objective and expectation, will eventually work, but not work in the near term.”
01:33
You said:
“Oh, now you heard. Oh, now you realize that I need to immerse myself into it. And... Oh! And I tried it. Oh, actually, it's hard. It's not easy. I mean, it's easy. Oh, it becomes hard, and I don't know whether this becomes more productive or not. I'm not sure whether this is the time spent, like, right time spent, or not. So, at the end, you're giving it up. So, you're just relying on the number three person. It's kind of like leading through the how things should work. I mean, this is one of the ways to work, but you're still not the expert of the vehicle you're driving. And these are safe. While you're giving the assignment and project and objective and OKR to your team, you might have your manager. If you're in the EDC level, I'm pretty sure you have some other big task or big priority to finish. So, you're normally don't spend time on things that are not priority for the daily, weekly, and quarterly basis. So, what happened? I mean, let's put this into the shoes of the team members. They're just MSU. They wanted to work on it, but they don't have time. They are not sure whether this time spent is not yielding the good output. They're scared to not going to get the good ratings and reviews and the reputation. So, they don't want to risk. So does you.”
01:49
You said:
“So this is why if you truly want your company to be AI-native, what you need is five. You need to let your people play and have fun while not worrying about the daily work, or at least for a week. At this point, AI is not that hard. If you're smart, employees are spending time for a week to set up the team, do whatever it takes. I'm not saying that we've got to do the hackathon. It's more about letting people give the mission to learn as much as possible. Learn as much as possible and try to think about what's the best way you can utilize it. And with a given time limit, the goal is what's the best way to try to come up with that. Let's say approximately for two weeks. One week, just build whatever you wanted. The second week, think about how we're going to implement this AI workflow into the team. And letting people to just floating around what could be possible. I know two weeks or one week even of the company time is invaluable, but so has the AI transformation.”
01:28
You said:
“First of all, giving the two weeks time limit is not to say that you're going to have fun. Everybody should come up with something. It's work. It's not fun. I mean, it's not play. But at the same time, you're not going to worry about the metrics you have to lift, and you have to adjust the goal. You have to adjust the KPI if it's necessary. And maybe if you're worried about, like, oh, not necessarily all people need to do it at the same time, then do it on a small scale. It's not going to be the end of the world.”
00:37
You said:
“And if you want it to be truly a native organization, this is the metaphor I was mentioning earlier, the Tesla versus the Kia EV. So let's say if your part of the vehicle is automated or, like, it's built on the system, I think the whole industry is going to work as expected. But if you try to, let's say, for the car, I think you can try to come up with a good example that everybody understands. If you try to just update the one system or maybe, like, there's this old model that you need to have the new part, that is not really compatible with what it does. So the new part is operating twice better than before. The problem is that you have to connect or adopt translating those energies into the existing system, which is going to take a lot more effort than just putting the old part. That's why I think people are just going back to work their own. So what's implied in this one is that, I mean, I'm not saying that you have to fully change everything at once, but if you, let's say, you have a small number of the type three person, and then if they try to, like, accelerate the process, some other people will be caught in the middle. They are going to spend even more time trying to understand what they do and how they translate. So that's why this, like, simultaneous, more of the synchronous and simultaneous transformation is the key for the change.”

You said:
“That's the end of the story. What do you think? I mean, don't sugarcoat it, first of all.”
00:07
You said:
“Is there anything to improve?”
00:01
You said:
“No transcription available”
03:11
You said:
“What do you think about this article?”
00:04
You said:
“And this is not a part of the story, but I wanted to brainstorm with you. So when I managed the design system, what I realized is that system-level changes need to happen pretty much at once. Because if you're trying to just change some part of the system, it's going to cost more. And if you're just keep changing, and some part are changing, some part are not, and all this combination of system will be the legacy. So that's why for the system-level changes, you need to, I know it's going to be hard. It is hard, but you're going to have to invest time on it and flip it around. I mean, this is what I thought, but can you find the industry example or any other case studies or articles or papers about this type of systematic changes need to be happening as sweet as possible. This is my hypothesis.”
01:08
You said:
“So I'm not talking about the services. I mean, I wanted to have the good metaphor that why there's incremental changes in system. I mean, majority of people will do this way. But the problem with this one, just same as the design system changes, you're not going to see the maintenance cost, which will be spread it out to the ICs. And that's going to be the burden. And also, that's the same as you're adding the high-tech part to the old cars.”
00:39
You said:
“And the other part I wanted to address is that you need to look at the market. The AI market is like driving like crazy, and if you're still thinking about just bringing the high-technology parts to your system, you're gonna lose it. And the only way you can put up with is if you're at least riding the same vehicle as those people who are riding the crazy AI vehicle, and then you're gonna stand on the same starting line again, otherwise you're already behind.”
