For the time being, I'm going to focus on work like AI-native, which I'm going to talk about the AI automation, AI-assisted work, and AI-native like a team is not there yet, but I wanted to talk about how we're going to get there.”

“I'm going to give you the full context about how I landed on the AI-assisted GPT-S for the UX writing.”
00:08
You said:
“So, I'm going to talk about the entire narrative of how I was planning for the AI native feature for UX writing.”
00:09
You said:
“So the way it started is that...”
00:02
You said:
“It started with a UX... No, no, no, I'm not done yet. So UX Writer left the company because she didn't feel empowered to work as a UX Writer. Because we have only one UX Writer, and that's the only resources that were given from the company. But at the same time, the product team, including the engineering team, is about 400. And she cannot be really involved in many of the key projects. It's more likely she's kind of reviewing what's right or wrong. At the same time, the product team who are working on building this product has the ownership to change the content in a way they want it. So she felt less empowered. And even for the marketing, the content design guides, they're well-attempted to follow the traditional pitch flow. So basically, she is the UX Writer, the one person covering the entire company, but her authority wasn't there.”
01:02
You said:
“No, no, no, no, no. Stop there. I'm just going to give you full context so I can work on the articles later on. So, I got a little bit challenged from the CEO that what was the impact? I mean, I can see that there is a foreseeable impact from the product team. Everybody loves to work with her. Everybody wants to have the UX provider, but at the same time, from the company-wise perspective, we know that we still have way far to go to make the consistent writing or make the impact out of it. So, that's the realization I have. With the limit, I thought at the beginning, just like the way I work at Meta, I thought I am going to scale this UX writing org to scale, not to scale to Meta, but I wanted to enter more scale. But at the same time, the impact wasn't proved, demonstrated.”

You said:
“Devaluating.”

You said:
“So, I mean, I'm not asking you to respond much, but I want you to just, no, no, no, no, no, no. So, for this conversation, I don't want you to talk long until I say, let's discuss. I'm just gonna use it as my memory to drop the article. Right? Did you copy that?”
00:22
You said:
“So, that's the moment that I think about, what's the best way to maximize the impact of the one-person UX provider if we are hiring again, and who should we hire for at the time of the AI emergence coming in? So, this is the time the ChatGPT coming along, GPT-S, was published, went on public. So, this is the moment I think about, how do we make the one-person UX provider covering the entire org, and make it consistent, and while keeping the total voice consistency alone, while meeting the expectations from the different teams?”

“I don't want you to, uh, I don't want you to, so I'm going to put the copy and paste this later on, so I don't want you to see much. So whenever I pause, just say I copied it.”

You said:
“So, the more I think about it, the core of the Eurexian binding is...”
00:06
You said:
“How to communicate to the users with a consistent brand voice while making… So that's for the customer face. And for the internal facing, there are not… Majority of people who are working on the content design or UX writing happen to be not experts on writing audio, but also on writing paragraphs that is tailored for the user convenience. So how can we make the tool for everybody to have the access? So then things got clear that we need to set up the total voice for the brands. That is applicable for all different part of the businesses from the contents, commerce, the interior contractor, which requires a significant trust from the users. And there are a lot of jargons. So I wanted to hire someone who can actually be a brand UX writer who can manage the tone and voice and try to map that out into the functional UX writing. So that's how I started. So let me… That's one. Can you copy?”
01:11
You said:
“So, because of the limits, my talk was cutting off. So, let me repeat it. So, we were able to come up with the tonal voice, and we shared with the CPUs, and we got the permission that this is the official tonal voice for the company. But the problem is that with the official tonal voices, the problem is that people cannot, I mean, people appreciate the tonal voices, but they don't know how to apply it. So, this is where I think about the GPT-S to amplify the impact of the tonal voice. But at the same time, we need to have the training set of the data that is applying the tonal voice to the existing use case. So, that's why for the quarters, we work on the key projects, like the QDs and UX writing for the products, and try to find the areas that we can apply the tonal voices and try to engage with the internal teams to whether they like the results and whether they are performing well or not. So, fast forward, we were able to get a lot of results out of it, and we got the tonal voice, and we have the training data set, and we were adding the do's and don'ts pieces, and we are ready to work on the GPT-S. There is some other format of the AI we can try to work with. Of course, we tapped into the multiple AI services, and we tried to contact the AI UX writing services, but we ended up deciding building the AI UX writing tool on our own because the maintenance, if we cannot really manage the tools because the UX writing will evolve over time, we cannot make things adjustable. And also, tonal voice could be improved over time, so that's why we ended up deciding working on the GPT-S.”
01:54
You said:
“This is a copy, and the way we kind of work on this one is a little bit strategic, mainly because from my previous experience with working with the UX provider and working with the other teams, the problem is that they are really reluctant, because they were not looking for the UX provider's help. So that's why we strategically seek for the opportunity, which are the teams that look for the help from the UX provider most, and they're willing to work with us on our tools we're building, and also we can try to build up the trust from the team, and also the demonstration of whether the results, the text results from the AWS UX Writing book is better, and also reduce the efficiency of the writing, and that's how we started. So we ended up building the general GPT-S for the AWS Mechanical UX Writing, but we ended up realizing that while we're keeping the core framework of the internal voices, the way we should apply the UX writing should be a little bit nuanced, because they're working on the different domains. So that's why we ended up building the AWS Writing book for the specific team and the versions. Copy?”
01:32
You said:
“And then later on, so we start getting the inbound call from the teams that they wanted to build their own OLC-H writing code for their own usage. They are now willing to provide a data set about how they have been writing for. So that's the part that we feel like this is going to work. Because we have a bunch of other people looking for the OLC-H writing GPT-S, and also it's becoming a part of the introductory package for the e-commerce. And then later, so this, and also we ended up like the announcing on the company-wise meetings about the OLC-H writing votes. And this is where we're going to kind of in increasing the product of the entire team who are working on the exploit. And”
00:59
You said:
“And that's the phase one. That's the phase one. Phase one is building the tonal voice. Second part is applying the tonal voice and being liked from the team so they're willing to play with us. The phase three is that the fundamental problem with GPT-S is that now we know that people are using and leveraging the laws providing GPT-S. The problem is that we don't know what's the actual results. And also, sometimes we wanted to change the tonal voices and we wanted to see, like, how does this little changes massively impact on the all different fields at once, which means that we don't have the data on the client. We don't have the data on the client for the entire year surviving. And if we're not recapturing what's shipped to the customer, and then we're not going to re-increase efficiencies, but at the same time, it's kind of on the perception of it, but it's not the metrics we can prove. So this is the part I started working on, the building of the UX archive by working on the localization. So I hired an AI workflow operator who set it up. First of all, I work with engineers that how the taxes are being handled in this company. I mean, basically, it's not trackable because it's all hard-coded. So that's why I come up with a plan that hiring the AI workflow operator and try to just build the plug-ins that automate their key generation and stores their localize. And eventually, we're going to have the UX writing to these that are the synchronous to the product shipping. And in that way, we know that we're going to know that once the tone of voice or rules are changing, we know how it's going to direct, how it's actually going to be impacted in a specific way. And so in the phase three, we're building the UX writing archive. But at the same time, oh, did you copy it? It's too long, probably.”
02:23
You said:
“And the phase four is that now we're in the process of building the UX writing archive, or GD. The next part is that how to make things are synchronous while GPTs cannot really store the data. And this is where the cursor and code and the AI workflow for the product development is coming in handy. So basically, now we have the cloud skills for the cursors. And what it can do is it's the same as the GPT-S UX writing bot, but still it access to the DBs. And it can read the existing database. And that's why it comes up with a very consistent UX writing. Did you copy it?”
00:54
You said:
“So this is where we're at. And I think this is, so some part of the AI assistive, GPT-AI, GPT-S is the AI assistive. And the building the DLUX archive is the AI automation. And the last part is something I haven't finished, but what I was finding is the agency flows. Did you copy it?”
00:24
You said:
“The last part is that once the tonal voice GPT-S is now translated into the cloud skills connected with the UX writing, the database, and now we can try to come up with the text. And also, I think the last part I could have done is connecting the log of each contents and whether they're performing well or not. So we can try to evaluate, and also we're adding the evaluators, so it's fully autonomous for the UX writing. Did you copy it?”
00:39
You said:
“And this is the whole story in short summary. Now, let's try to discuss. So did you hear, did you understand what I was saying from the beginning to the end?”
00:11
You said:
“So when you, I mean, can you evaluate what do you think about the story as I manage it?”
00:08
You said:
“Do you think this is a very appropriate topic for the work-like native and build-for-native part of stories?”
00:07
You said:
“So, is there anything to improve or talk on? I know you're going to talk about what was the impact in the metrics, how much of the time released for the people who are using the GPTS, et cetera, right? But other than that, I mean, you can talk about those, but I also wanted to hear about how to make this story even more compelling.”
00:21
You said:
“And I think I was forgetting about where this, when this, just saying that this is entirely replacing the UXWriter. I think the way we're thinking about it is even for the UXWriter, there's a problem. So there are products that are text-centric and the core part of the product, the text in the product is an additive feature. So we want to automate those additive features. Still important for the users and for the brands, but at the same time, we wanted to save the time for the UXWriter to really work on the important key projects, which is like TVs and other brand activities.”
00:48
You said:
“Hello?”
00:02
You said:
“So, I just wanted to find the additional text writings. It's a kind of, let's say, notification font, the UX writings, the bottom to UX writing. This could be done better with the UX writing, the database, which was winning, and also the real-time checking of how this is performing. This is probably better to be for the AI automation, the AI-agentic flows. But the role of the UX writing is more about the feeling, how we can try to just come up with the word spacing like a poet would deliver with every instance. So, it's not about the automation. It's about how we can elevate the spheres of the breath. So, this is where the UX writing, AI-agentic flows comes in handy. So, still humans need it.”
00:53
You said:
“So if you're breaking down this into multiple articles, how many pieces I should write?”
00:05
You said:
“The last part I wanted to talk about is the reason why, as a design leader, that I talk about the UX writing-only AI native feature is that the text is the best, I mean, larger language model is writing is fully on the text side while it's creating video events. So that's why I wasn't starting with the UX writing and building out the roadmap and strategies for the UX writing. But this can be applied to all the other product developments, which I will focus later on. So I can think about it. So yesterday we talked about the data and all that integration, trying to focus on what's the impactful opportunity area from the analyzing data behavior. And also the QA analysis try to just increase the productivity, etc. So this is the kind of like intro piece that how I think about the AI native workflow and how I'm going to expand it. So this is something, this is the kind of the foundation or milestone of the AI native workflow. What do you think?”
01:16
You said:
“So, if you're giving the harsh critique on this article, what would you think? I mean, let's say this is one of the strong cases studied, while this is not the regular thought-of-use cases that I should pitch, which I'm going to include.”
00:16
You said:
“So, from the user value perspective, this is something we are gravitating towards building it. I mean, obviously using the OLCX writing book is better than someone who are not as good at writing. Obviously, it's a shorter, and also it has the same tonal voice and same tonal principle applied to it. So, it's better for the users, and maybe I can try to come up with a make up the user satisfaction stories about it. But at the same time, what I'm saying is it's not done yet. It's getting better and better. And at the end, it's going to be just create more value and create a measurable impact. And that's where all the UX writers are looking for. They wanted to have the wider impact. And what's most interesting about this one is this is all by one UX writer, not 100. And there's no engineering support. This was conducted by the lead planning and setting up the vision and strategy, but execution part is all on the UX writers. So, we're getting there. We're not there yet. So, I just wanted to be very honest about this one. This is the actual product. All the other product discussion details, I kind of make that a story of how I would have done it differently. But this is something have the real scenarios where experience is embedded into it.”

You said:
“So let's say if a hiring manager who are working on the AI startup only look at this article from the LinkedIn, what would they thought?”
00:11
You said:
“So even without seeing any of my portfolio, this article will convey a pretty strong message to the high-end manager, right?”
