# Brand 2.0 Case Study - What to Visualize

Visual elements to enhance the narrative and improve readability. Goal: 2-3 images per section showing concrete execution and impact.

---

## Problem Section (Showing the Gap)

**Option 1: Competitive Comparison**
- Left side: Ohouse brand positioning (mixed, cluttered feeling)
- Right side: 29cm brand positioning (organized, curated feeling)
- Visual impact: User's perception of the difference between platforms
- **Recommendation:** This is more concrete and has stronger impact. Shows exactly why users migrated.

**Option 2: User Journey Contrast**
- Before state: Confusing brand discovery flow
- After state: Clearer navigation/filtering
- Format: Diagram or side-by-side wireframes
- Less concrete than Option 1

**→ Choose Option 1 (Competitive Comparison)**

---

## Actions Section (Showing Actual Implementation)

**All three recommended:**

1. **Brand Home Screen**
   - New brand discovery experience
   - Shows design principles and brand values prominently

2. **Binary Shop Landing/Entry Point**
   - Visual representation of curated premium zone
   - Navigation, visual hierarchy, brand treatment

3. **Product Card Redesign**
   - How brand metadata is now emphasized
   - Before/after comparison showing elevated brand communication

**Why all three:** The concrete product execution is the most convincing proof point. Hiring managers/interviewers want to see exactly what you built.

## Results Section (Visualizing Performance Data)

**Option 1: Growth Chart**
- 2024 → 2025 GMV increase trajectory
- Shows momentum and sustained growth

**Option 2: Binary Shop Performance Metrics**
- Market share improvement: 58.1% (Dec 2024) → 93.3% (Mar 2025)
- Visual representation of explosive growth in IB segment

**Option 3: Key Metrics Dashboard**
- Consolidate: Conversion rate (+2.64%), GMV per purchase (+2.99%), market share trajectory
- One comprehensive visualization

**Recommendation:** Option 2 or 3. Since you already have many numbers in the text, one chart is sufficient. Option 2 (Binary Shop market share) is more striking visually and tells a clearer story.

## Reflection Section (Showing Organizational Ripple Effect)

**Ripple Effect Diagram**
- Center: Persona-driven strategy
- Branches outward to: Product, Biz Dev, O2O (Interior Design Services), and beyond
- Shows how each division adopted persona-based decision-making
- Visual representation of organizational influence and thought leadership

## Summary - Recommended Visual Layout

| Section | Visual Element | Purpose |
|---------|----------------|---------|
| **Problem** | Competitive positioning comparison (Ohouse vs 29cm) | Establishes the market gap and user migration |
| **Actions** | Brand Home screen + Binary Shop landing + Product card before/after | Proves concrete execution across discovery, curation, and brand communication |
| **Results** | Binary Shop market share growth chart (58.1% → 93.3%) | Shows dramatic impact and sustained momentum |
| **Reflection** | Ripple effect diagram (org-wide adoption) | Demonstrates thought leadership and org influence beyond direct delivery |

## Implementation Notes

- **Competitive comparison:** Consider using actual screenshots or clean mockups
- **Product screens:** Actual product screenshots (ensure brand/user data is anonymized if needed)
- **Market share chart:** Simple line graph or bar chart showing the trajectory
- **Ripple effect:** Keep it simple - circles/nodes connected by arrows showing information/decision-making flow

**Total images: 4-5 strategic visuals** (1 for Problem, 2-3 for Actions, 1 for Results, 1 for Reflection)

This balances visual engagement with narrative depth without overwhelming the reader.
