### **Brand 2.0 — Reframing Commerce Through Brand Identity**

### **Problem**

By 2023, Ohouse’s commerce growth had plateaued.
Users who once sought affordable, aesthetic furniture were now drawn to **brands with conviction** — products rooted in design values and identity, not mass production.
Platforms like *29cm* captured this audience. Meanwhile, premium brands avoided Ohouse because they were displayed alongside replicas and low-end sellers, eroding trust and brand equity.
Internally, teams lacked a unified understanding of the “target user,” leading to fragmented decisions across sourcing, design, and marketing.

### **Actions**

Led the strategic repositioning and cross-functional alignment for **Brand 2.0**, evolving it from a UI redesign into a company-wide brand transformation.

* **Defined research-based user and brand personas** that unified Product, Biz Dev, and Marketing under a single strategic lens, and **partnered across orgs** — Brand Biz, Growth Marketing, Data, and Engineering — to translate insight into execution.

  * Introduced two anchor personas: **Gina**, who values Ohouse’s accessible, functional furniture; and **Seah**, who gravitates toward trend-led, design-centric brands and represents the primary target persona for Brand 2.0.
  * The contrast between Gina and Seah clarified what problems we were solving for and how to balance aspirational and practical users within the same ecosystem.
* **Redesigned how users discover and experience brands** across Ohouse through the **Brand Home redesign**, **brand search**, and **Home Module** improvements.

  * These experiences allowed users to encounter each brand’s philosophy and curated product line more intuitively, while enabling premium partners to communicate their design identity within the commerce flow.
* **Launched Binary Shop**, a curated premium zone with creator-led campaigns and brand challenges, elevating perception of Ohouse as a lifestyle platform.

### **Reflection**

**Brand 2.0 proved that personas aren’t documentation — they’re alignment infrastructure.**
By grounding every decision in a shared user understanding, design became the unifying force connecting business ambition, brand identity, and user value.
This initiative redefined how Ohouse curates, presents, and grows with brands — setting the cultural and structural foundation for its next phase of lifestyle expansion.
