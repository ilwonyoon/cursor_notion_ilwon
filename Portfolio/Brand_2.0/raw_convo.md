“So I'm going to talk about what it is, and what I did, what my team did, and why I played an integral role in this project. So the brand 2.0 is coming out of the market trend that people are looking for, not known in the furniture, they want to buy the furniture that has the principle of their own, and also those, it's not the mass production market, this is more about the small market really growing rapidly in South Korea, that people are looking for really, people are not really buying the furniture, people wanted to buy the product of brands. And also, Ohaus is known for the middle range, no brands, but aesthetically pleasing brands. Now people are flocking to the other platform, like the 29cm, mainly because of that. And we have a lot of user requests, that why we're not dealing with this product. But the problem is that the way we're handling the product, and the way we're handling the brands is totally different from what they requested, what each brand requested. They want it to be treated differently, they don't want it to be fitted together with the similar look like with the designer brands, with the copycat designer brands. And that's why we need to have, this is not just about building the webpage, but the page that shows that, oh, this is the brand it is. This is more about starting as, this is the handling the request, otherwise they're not going to come into our store, come into our platform. And that's one challenge. The second challenge is, still the majority of the users are not looking for this product. So this is more of our close opportunity, if we're not going to do it, we're going to lose the market. At the same time, we don't want to lose the core user base, which is what they're looking for. The furniture is not really from the brands. So this is a juggling. And the third part is that this is the first time that the product has not been stored in the storage yet. So we need to figure out what brand we need to source it from.”

“And I think the major part that I wanted to talk about is that we didn't have any brands that we wanted to sell at that moment. I mean, we have some, but we didn't have those major brands that people are looking for.”

“This one is pretty critical because otherwise we don't know which friends to source, and this is where I put the emphasis that who we are targeting for, and what problem they're facing, and how we're going to solve it. So this is one of the central pieces.”

“Without the user personas, we probably would have talked about a lot of different solutions, brands that we wanted to target for, but everybody thinks differently. So that's why I think it was like the critical piece of the success of this project, because now we can imagine who we are solving for, and most likely they know someone like them. So when we talk about the project, everybody talks about asparagus that I would purchase or not, but this was kind of unifying the team into the same goal.”

“I'm going to talk about the project detail-wise. We wanted to have the dedicated space for the brands, which is related to the first part. We wanted to handle the request that they wanted to be different from other no-name brands, but at the same time, they wanted to deliver their brand principle to the customer, which is the home module and also the brand home page.”

“It's the two main problem and it's the two main solution. What do you think about this project as a evaluator, the hiring manager? I mean, I'm not going to use this as a use case, but this is one of the cases that I can emphasize on that setting up the parasona is a really key for the success of the project and also how much of the alignment is required for the cross-functional collaboration.”
