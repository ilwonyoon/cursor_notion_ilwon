### **Brand 2.0 — Reframing Commerce Through Brand Identity**

### **Problem**

By 2023, Ohouse's commerce growth had plateaued.
Users who once sought affordable, aesthetic furniture were now drawn to **brands with conviction** — products rooted in design values and identity, not mass production.
Platforms like *29cm* captured this audience. Meanwhile, premium brands avoided Ohouse because they were displayed alongside replicas and low-end sellers, eroding trust and brand equity.
Internally, teams lacked a unified understanding of the "target user," leading to fragmented decisions across sourcing, design, and marketing.

### **Actions**

Repositioned Brand 2.0 by anchoring **company-wide strategy around user personas** (Gina: accessibility-focused; Seah: design-centric), partnering across Product, Biz Dev, Marketing, Data, and Engineering.

* Redesigned brand discovery (Brand Home, search, Home Module) to elevate how premium brands communicate their identity within the ecosystem.

* Launched Binary Shop, a curated premium zone that repositioned Ohouse as a design-led lifestyle destination.

* **Brand conversion rate +2.64 %** and **GMV per purchase +2.99 %** (p = 0.37).
* Significant **increase in inbound requests** from premium and design-driven brands.
* Shifted market perception from a *mass-market aggregator* to a **destination for design-led brands**.
* Established an internal benchmark for how **user persona–driven alignment** can deliver measurable business and cultural impact.

### **Reflection**

Brand 2.0 proved that **design-driven strategy translates directly into business results**.

More importantly, it established a shared understanding across the organization:
**why defining personas and anchoring strategy around user insight matters**.
This became a catalyst for other teams and business units—Product, Biz Dev, O2O (interior design services), and beyond—to adopt persona-based decision-making within their own contexts.
Rather than a one-off success, it created a ripple effect where each division applied the same rigor to their strategy.

In essence, we redefined Design's role: from *decoration* to **strategic infrastructure**.
