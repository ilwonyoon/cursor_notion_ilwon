Hey there! All right, let’s dive straight in. I'm here to be that direct, results-driven design mentor for you. I’ll cut through the noise and keep everything outcome-driven, just like you asked. So let’s get right to whatever you want to tackle, and we’ll break it down into clear, actionable steps.

“So I'm going to change the narrative for the OWASP AI short-term strategy. So I don't think that you're going to remember, but when I talk about the OWASP AI vision for the long-term strategy, I'm going to tap into those people who are having the most pain points, which is people who are finding a place where they want to live. And eventually, we're going to stretch into the smaller pieces. So they wanted to refresh the space with a small item, so like a craft, a collar, rugs, arch, and what does the piece stand for, like plant tree?”

Hey there! Let’s dive right in. I’ll keep things direct and focused, just like you want. Let me know where you want to start sharpening that narrative, and we’ll break it down into really actionable, no-fluff steps.

“So did you hear me out about how I wanted to shift the short-term strategy for DOS AI starting from the smaller pieces that we can have the definition of the problem of solving states and also it's the kind of atomic the components of designing for the interiors.”

ChatGPT said:
Absolutely, I’m right with you. So you’re basically looking to shift that short-term strategy by zooming in on those smaller, more “atomic” elements—like individual décor pieces or small changes that really define the space. Got it. We’ll frame it around tackling those immediate, tangible pain points first, and then build upward from there. Let’s break it into clear steps and make sure it’s aligned with that direct, results-driven approach you’re aiming for.

You said:
“So, I mean, I want to discuss about this approach. I mean, after kind of going through the multiple months of iteration, this is what I have learned that I think starting small is definitely a benefit, not the benefit of building the product because we can really focus while the number of the user pools are big. So we can easily meet the people. So there's a lot of benefit of starting small in terms of the tech, in terms of the user interview, in terms of the tracking, whether we're solving the problem or not.”

Absolutely, that makes

You said:
“instead of starting big.”

ChatGPT said:
Exactly. So let’s cut straight to it: starting small is a really strategic move, and you’re spot-on. By focusing on those smaller pieces, you get to zero in on clear, manageable user goals. That means you can validate whether you’re really solving the right problems more quickly and adjust without getting bogged down in huge, complex launches. So yeah, let’s lean into that. It’s a solid, outcome-driven approach and it’ll let you track and iterate much more effectively than trying to solve everything in one go.

You said:
“So I think this is a valuable lesson for me because I set up a vision, I wanted to reach that vision, but to get to the vision, if I'm doing the startups, you have to have the traction, you have to have the number of the people, you have to have the revenue and metrics that you can prove that this is the right direction to have it. So setting a vision is really important, but how we're getting the traction is also the critical part of it. So I think what I have learned from the O-House is to kind of tapping into the smaller impactful pieces and zeroing on getting the impact as soon as faster, as soon as possible, but at the same time what's missing from the O-House is that what's our long-term strategy and where we want it to be. That's why we're keep hitting the blocker that what we want it to be. So this is kind of the strength in my muscle about as a product builder because eventually I think everybody becoming the product guy or product builder, not product designer or product manager.”

ChatGPT said:
Absolutely, and you’re really hitting the nail on the head with that reflection. Setting a big, compelling vision is crucial, but you’re spot on that traction—those smaller, high-impact steps—is what really proves you’re moving in the right direction. So think of it as a muscle you’re strengthening: you’re learning how to balance that long-term vision with the immediate, tactical wins that build momentum. And that’s the essence of being a strong product builder, not just a designer or a PM.

So let’s keep that direct approach: you’ve identified the gap and the value. Now we just make sure you’ve got both the short-term traction plan and a clarified long-term narrative. That way, you’ve got a rock-solid story that shows you can do both: deliver immediate impact and drive toward that bigger vision.
