## 1️⃣ **Before Starting - What's the Ohouse?**

**The User Journey**

Ohouse helps people move through four design moments:

1. **Find** — Explore thousands of real homes for inspiration
2. **Inspire** — Discover specific styles and products that match their taste
3. **Plan** — Visualize how furniture and decor fit in *their* space
4. **Execute** — Buy products and work with contractors
5. **Refresh** — Continuously redesign as life changes

**Our Promise: "Visualize, Decide, and Act — Confidently"**

Most people find interior design overwhelming. They see inspiration online, but can't translate it to their own space. Ohouse solves this by connecting inspiration → visualization → purchase → execution.

**Why This Matters for What Comes Next**

Over the past decade, we've built deep expertise in home + living. The 3C flywheel (Content, Community, Commerce) proved we could drive engagement and profitability. But the current model has hit its ceiling — content creation is manual, domain expansion is limited, and users still see us primarily as a commerce platform.

Now, AI changes what's possible. But before we explain the pivot, you need to understand the foundation we're building from.
