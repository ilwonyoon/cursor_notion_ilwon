## 2. Visualization & Digital Twin Technology
**Summary:** Room Planner + AR scanning + LLM-based AI generates accurate 3D simulations and furniture recommendations beyond manual effort, with acceptable rendering time (1 min per trial).

**Source files:** 04, 05, 06, 16

---

## 3. Market Research & Competitive Data
**Summary:** 3D visualization in real estate/staging proves market demand: 20-31% faster sales, 87% view increase, 73% faster transaction closure, 6-10% price premium, up to 3600% ROI.

**Source files:** 03, 04, 05, 06

## 5. Business Model & Monetization
**Summary:** Primary: B2B subscription ($99-$1,500/month) to real estate platforms. Secondary: Consumer free tier drives traffic, ads/affiliate revenue, partnership monetization layers.

**Source files:** 04, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18

---

## 6. Community & Creator Program
**Summary:** Commerce-focused Q&A community (not entertainment-first), 80K DAU, 50K+ weekly questions, tiered creator incentives (affiliate, group-buy, in-app monetization), achieved +20% MAU growth.

**Source files:** 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15

---

## 7. B2B vs Consumer Strategy
**Summary:** Two-stage GTM: Consumer app proves value/PMF, then B2B partnerships (Zillow, Redfin, 직방, 다방) deliver stable recurring revenue. Consumer lifecycle = transaction-based; B2B = ongoing professional need.

**Source files:** 10, 14, 15, 17, 18

---

## 8. Go-to-Market & Execution Strategy
**Summary:** Real estate platform integration as primary GTM lever. Phased rollout: consumer PMF validation → ecosystem partner integration → white-label enterprise offerings. Speed and iteration emphasized.

**Source files:** 02, 10, 16, 18

---

## 9. 3C Flywheel Connection
**Summary:** Rebalanced existing 3C structure: Community Q&A drives inflow via SEO, Creator programs drive conversion confidence, Commerce closes sales. Achieved breakeven through this rebalancing, not new expansion.

**Source files:** 10, 11, 12, 13

---

## 10. Portfolio/Pitch Strategy & Leadership Narrative
**Summary:** Frame as X→Y→Z (problem → decision → results). Show org/team impact, not just hands-on execution. Director-level positioning. L7 interview format: Clarify context → Strategic framework → Business impact.

**Source files:** 10, 11, 17, 18

---

## 11. Team Structure & Collaboration
**Summary:** Room Planner + AI teams merged. Single UX writer orchestrated 800-person org through AI tooling. Research embedded in product cycles. Cross-functional autonomy with alignment (not command-and-control).

**Source files:** 11, 18

---

## 12. Challenges & Unresolved Questions
**Summary:** Scaling beyond Korea difficult. Lifestyle Expansion precedent = failure to ignore. AI rendering accuracy vs. user expectations tradeoff. Consumer repeat usage (one-time vs. lifecycle). Profitability on consumer side uncertain.

**Source files:** 04, 10, 11, 16, 18

---

## 13. Metrics & Success Criteria
**Summary:** D+7 retention benchmark: 40-50% (solid for utility tools). Community DAU ~80K, MAU +20% growth. Leading metrics (adoption, dwell, answer rate) → lagging metrics (conversion, LTV, retention). OMTM depends on phase.

**Source files:** 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18

---

## 14. Market Size & Business Opportunity
**Summary:** Virtual staging market $260M (2024) → $1.32B (2033, 17.8% CAGR). Home remodeling $545.6B. Real estate transaction = highest budget commitment moment. Global expansion potential beyond Korea.

**Source files:** 03, 04, 05, 06, 16

## 15. Room Planner (RP): Product-Market Fit & Scaling Signal
**Summary:** Room Planner achieved strong PMF (40min dwell vs 8min platform avg, 40% monthly retention) but faces scaling bottleneck due to tool complexity. Key insight: impulse purchase metric (30% of RP revenue = first-time discovery → purchase within 24h) proves that digital twin visualization drives confident action. This is the core validation for why AI-powered photo→3D workflow is necessary to scale.

**Key Metrics:**
- **Growth:** 24년 상반기 31M원 → 하반기 110M원 → 25년 상반기 400M원 (13배 YoY)
- **Engagement:** 40분 평균 사용시간 (5x platform average), 40% monthly retention
- **Revenue Impact:** ARPU 76% increase (643.86원 → 1,134.98원), ARPPU 36% increase (128K → 175K 원)
- **Impulse Purchase:** 30% of RP revenue comes from first discovery → purchase within 24h (없었던 상품을 RP에서 처음 발견하고 즉시 구매)
- **Category Leaders:** 거울류(20%), 화장대(15%), 수납장(4%) contribution to GMV
- **User Behavior:** 20% actively use measuring tool for accuracy; primary goal = "실제 내 방의 배치 실험"

**Scaling Challenge:** Heavy tool requiring furniture planning knowledge + technical proficiency = limits scale. Only intensive users (heavy engagement) sustain high retention.

**AI Solution Rationale:** Photo → voice description → 3D RP → easy refinement removes blank canvas problem. Users start from *their actual space* (not imaginary), making tool accessible to non-power-users while maintaining high conversion quality.

**Strategic Insight:** RP's impulse purchase metric (30%) is the strongest proof that "visualization = confidence = action." Ohouse AI amplifies this by making RP accessible to 10x more users.

## 16. Competitive Differentiation vs. Generic AI Design Tools
**Summary:** Generic AI design tools (competitors) excel at concept generation and style transfer but structurally fail on core problems. Ohouse AI's integrated infrastructure (photo analysis + Room Planner + real catalog) solves 3 critical gaps competitors cannot replicate:

1. **Lifestyle Understanding through Photo Analysis** - Reverse-engineer user's actual living patterns (furniture longevity preference, open space priority, storage needs) from space choices, not abstract "what's your style?" quiz responses

2. **Accurate Spatial Scale via Room Planner** - Guarantee true-to-life measurements (not "surprise when it arrives"), eliminating the endemic scale accuracy failure that plagues competitors. Room Planner's 20% user adoption of measuring tool proves users prioritize accuracy.

3. **Whole-Home Coherence Infrastructure** - Multi-room photo analysis + real integrated product catalog enables color/material consistency across spaces. Competitors cannot match this without dedicated inventory system; requires B2B infrastructure Ohouse already possesses.

**Why This Matters for Part 2 Strategy:** These aren't "nice-to-haves." They're structural impossibilities for LLM-first tools or generic design platforms. Ohouse's defensibility comes from: (a) photo-to-constraint mapping expertise, (b) Room Planner integration, (c) real product database with durability signals. Replicating requires building the entire Ohouse infrastructure stack—not just better AI.
