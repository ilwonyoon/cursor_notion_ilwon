오늘 PM이랑 ohouse ai 롱텀 비전 정리하려고. 

난 여전히 어떤 마켓의 어떤 유저를 공략할 것인가가 핵심이라고 생각하고 부동산 렌트 및 매입을 하는 유저가 핵심이라고 생각함. 혹은 부동산 렌트 및 매입을 주도하는 사이트들을 대상으로 문제를 해결하는 방향으로 접근해서 그 사용자들에게도 혜택을 연결하는 방향으로 생각해. 

이유는 디지털 트윈 (앞으로 내가 살 공간)을 만들게만 하면 거기서부터 우리가 컨슈머 대상으로 할 수 있는게 정말 많거든 

그리고 실제 이사할 때 예산을 가장 크게 쓰는 구간이기도 하고

Here’s how I’d sharpen your thinking before your PM sync:

1. Anchor the Long-Term Bet
You’re right: defining the market and target user is the first domino. Without clarity, everything else (features, GTM, monetization) becomes noise.
Your stance:

Target user = people about to spend big on housing (renting or buying).

Target B2B angle = real estate portals / platforms that aggregate those users.
Why this is strong: you’re inserting yourself upstream at the point of the biggest life event + highest budget allocation.

2. Why Real Estate Transaction Users Are Core
High intent, high spend → users are already primed to open wallets (furniture, services, renovation).

Digital twin leverage → once a user models their “future home,” you unlock a cascade of adjacent opportunities: commerce, services, financing, insurance.

Market inefficiency → real estate platforms are transactional but not experiential. You can bridge the gap by helping users imagine, plan, and act.

3. Strategic Options
Frame this as two complementary paths (not either/or):

Consumer-first play

Own the user directly.

Hook: “Design your new home digitally before you move in.”

Expansion: commerce tie-ins, renovation, service booking.

Risk: requires large-scale distribution.

Platform/B2B play

Partner with real estate portals (Zillow, Realtor.com in the US, 직방/다방 in KR).

Hook: “Turn listings into lived-in experiences.”

Expansion: license Ohouse AI as an infrastructure layer for real estate.

Risk: dependence on platform adoption and integration timelines.

You can sequence them: start B2B (distribution shortcut), then layer consumer extensions once user base + trust is built.

4. How to Position in the Meeting
North Star Vision: “Ohouse AI becomes the default way people imagine and plan their next home—whether renting, buying, or browsing real estate platforms.”

Why now: AI lowers the barrier to creating a digital twin; no competitor has nailed the ‘move-in journey’ yet.

Next 3–5 years:

Phase 1: Build PMF around “digital twin of your future home.”

Phase 2: Integrate with commerce + renovation flows.

Phase 3: Extend into B2B real estate platforms, monetizing as SaaS/infrastructure.

👉 My push: Don’t just say “real estate users spend the most.” Frame it as “real estate transactions are the highest-leverage entry point because they unlock lifetime value across housing, furnishing, and services.” That positions Ohouse AI as more than interior styling—it’s the entry funnel to the housing economy.

Do you want me to help you draft a 1-page vision narrative you can read directly to your PM in the meeting, with sections for Market, Target User, Why Now, Phased Approach? That would make this airtight.

Let's create a one-page vision and narrative.

Perfect. Here’s a tight one-page vision narrative you can take into the PM sync. It’s structured like something a VP would bring into a strategy discussion:

Ohouse AI – Long-Term Vision
1. North Star
Ohouse AI will become the default way people imagine, plan, and move into their next home. By turning real estate transactions into lived-in digital twins, we unlock both consumer delight and business opportunity across the entire housing economy.

2. Market & Target Users
Core user: People renting or buying homes — the moment when budgets peak and decisions matter most.

Core partner: Real estate portals (e.g., Zillow, Realtor.com, 직방/다방) that aggregate these high-intent users.

Why it matters:

Renters/buyers are already committed to spending — on homes, furnishings, renovation, and services.

Today’s real estate platforms stop at listings. Users can’t see themselves living there. Ohouse AI bridges that gap.

3. Strategic Opportunity
Digital twin of your future home is the entry point. Once created, it becomes the foundation for:

Consumer extensions: furnishing, renovation, financial planning, service booking.

Platform integrations: B2B partnerships with real estate portals, embedding Ohouse AI to elevate listings into lived-in experiences.

Business moat: Owns the first moment of housing decision-making and scales across categories.

4. Phased Roadmap (3–5 Years)
Phase 1 – Consumer PMF

Let movers & renters create digital twins of their future homes.

Focus: speed, realism, confidence.

Phase 2 – Ecosystem Integration

Tie digital twins into commerce (furniture, renovation, services).

Expand beyond inspiration into transactions.

Phase 3 – Platform Infrastructure

Partner with real estate portals to power AI-driven listing experiences.

Monetize as SaaS/infrastructure while maintaining consumer channel.

5. Why Now
AI has lowered the barrier to creating realistic, personalized digital environments.

Real estate remains transactional and underserved in user experience.

Whoever owns the “future home digital twin” owns the downstream housing economy.

6. Vision Statement
Ohouse AI transforms housing decisions into confident, joyful experiences — making the digital twin of your future home the starting point for how you move, furnish, and live.

This fits neatly on one page, but it’s loaded with strategic clarity.

Would you like me to tighten it into a “pitch mode” script (2–3 minutes verbal delivery) so you can use it in the PM meeting without reading like a memo?
