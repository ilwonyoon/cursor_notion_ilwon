Impact of 3D Interactive Floorplans on Real Estate Transactions (U.S.)
Introduction
3D interactive floorplans and virtual tours (e.g. Matterport, Zillow 3D Home, RoomPlanner, RoOomy) are changing how properties are marketed. Unlike static photos or 2D floorplans, these tools provide an immersive, walk-through experience and interactive maps of a home’s layout. This investigation compiles case studies and data on how such technology affects vacancy time (days on market), user engagement (click-through rates, views, and dwell time), and conversion rates (leases or sales). The goal is to see if 3D virtual tours help properties rent or sell faster than traditional 2D presentations, and to summarize key performance metrics from industry sources.
Reduced Vacancy Time (Faster Leasing & Sales)
One primary benefit reported with 3D tours is a reduction in the time a property remains unleased or unsold:
Faster Home Sales: Multiple studies have found homes sell faster when a 3D tour is available. An analysis of 143,000+ MLS listings (2016–2019) showed listings with a 3D walkthrough closed up to 31% faster (in one region) than those without
matterport.com
. Another study in a Southern U.S. metro found houses with a Matterport 3D “digital twin” sold 20% faster (i.e. fewer days on market) than comparable homes using only traditional photos
matterport.com
. For example, a Keller Williams team that adopted 3D tours saw their average days on market drop from 30 to 21 days after six months (a 9-day improvement)
matterport.com
.
Faster Rental Turnover: 3D tours also speed up apartment leasing. A Detroit property manager noted that offering virtual tours can reduce vacancy days by ~10%, translating to units being filled up to 9 days faster on average
logicalpm.com
. In a nationwide ROI study, professional 3D content helped landlords lease properties as much as 15 days faster, significantly cutting vacancy periods
planomatic.com
. During the COVID-19 surge in virtual leasing, Zillow reported some rentals were being secured entirely online – in one survey 72% of renters said they would sign a lease sight-unseen if a 3D tour is available, and 82% of landlords using 3D tours were able to rent their property 100% online without in-person showings
inman.com
inman.com
. This remote leasing trend means vacant units can be occupied sooner.
Higher Listing Visibility: Properties with 3D/VR content often get special visibility boosts on listing sites, which indirectly shortens time on market. Zillow, for instance, gives 3D Home tour listings premium placement in search results, helping attract more eyeballs earlier
zillow.com
. More exposure can translate to faster inquiries and offers, reducing the listing’s overall market time.
Case in point: Zillow’s data during March 2020 (when 3D tours became vital) showed homes with a 3D Home tour were getting 50% more visitors and were saved 60% more often by users, indicating heightened interest that can lead to quicker deals
inman.com
. Agents noted that virtual tours let serious buyers/renters “pre-screen” properties, so when an inquiry comes, it’s from a highly interested party ready to move fast. This streamlines the sales/leasing process and cuts down on wasted showings
sjcmanagement.com
sjcmanagement.com
.
Nevertheless, not all studies find a dramatic speed-up in every scenario. Recent post-pandemic research (75,000 home sales in 2021–22) suggests that when high-quality photos and descriptions are already in place, adding a 3D tour alone did not significantly shorten days on market
library.hbs.edu
library.hbs.edu
. The early COVID-era gains in speed may have been temporary when buyers had no choice but to rely on virtual tools. In normal conditions, virtual tours are helpful but not a magic bullet for time-on-market – they need to be used alongside good visuals and pricing strategy. Still, the consensus in industry surveys is that 3D/VR content gives a competitive edge and can only help (not hurt) a listing’s chance to close faster

.
Higher Engagement: Views, Click-Throughs & Dwell Time
3D interactive floorplans clearly boost online engagement with listings compared to traditional 2D photos or floorplan images:
Increased Views & Click-Through Rate: Listings featuring virtual tours consistently receive more views and clicks. Realtor.com statistics show listings with a virtual tour get 87% more views on average than those without
snappr.com
. Similarly, a Planet Home study found real estate listings with immersive tours are clicked 40% more often than listings using photos alone
snappr.com
. This means in search results, buyers are more likely to click through to the detail page if a 3D tour or interactive plan is indicated. In fact, many buyers now filter by 3D tour availability – for example, Redfin noted that its 3D walkthrough views jumped 563% in early 2020 as home shoppers actively sought out listings offering virtual tours
photoup.net
.
Longer Dwell Time: Once on the listing page, users tend to spend much more time engaging with interactive content. Virtual tours invite viewers to navigate through rooms, resulting in higher “dwell time.” One analysis found that visitors stay on websites with virtual tours 5 to 10 times longer than on sites with only static imagery
snappr.com
. In real estate listings, brokers report that prospective buyers spend about 3X longer viewing a listing that includes a 3D tour versus one with just photos
novavirtualtours.com
. This extended exploration can be attributed to the curiosity and interactivity factor – users can pan 360°, zoom in on details, and switch to a dollhouse or floorplan view to understand layout. The more time a prospect spends immersed in a virtual walkthrough, the more familiar they become with the property, often leading to deeper interest.
Higher User Engagement Rates: Interactive floorplans (clickable layouts linked to panoramas) further boost engagement. Zillow found that 69% of buyers say a dynamic, interactive floor plan is very useful in helping decide on a home
virtuance.com
. It provides context that static 2D floorplans lack, making it easier to envision the flow of the home. Because of this, Zillow now highlights listings that have both a 3D tour and interactive floorplan – these listings “appear more prominently and receive more engagement” in Zillow’s search results and email alerts
zillow.com
. In marketing terms, richer content leads to higher click-through rates (CTR) from emails and listing feeds. Renters browsing Zillow or Apartments.com similarly are drawn to the “virtual tour” badge; one property marketing firm observed that adding a 3D tour increased online inquiry rates by 120% (more than doubling the leads generated) for rental listings
planomatic.com
planomatic.com
.
More Saves & Shares: Engagement also shows in how often users save or share listings with 3D media. Zillow’s research during 2020 noted that homes with 3D Home tours were saved by users 60% more frequently on their platform
inman.com
 – a strong indicator of buyer interest. Such listings also get shared on social media and via link more often, increasing their exposure. The immersive content essentially markets itself, as interested viewers are excited to show the virtual tour to spouses, friends, or roommates, further widening the audience.
Summary of Engagement Uplift: Interactive tours clearly capture more eyeballs and hold attention longer than traditional 2D listings. The table below highlights a few key engagement metrics “before vs. after” adding 3D tours:
Metric	Traditional Listing	With 3D Tour	Improvement
Click-Through Rate (from search results)
snappr.com
Baseline (photos only)	+40% click rate	↑ 40% more clicks into listing
Listing Views (Detail page)
snappr.com
llcbuddy.com
Baseline (100% traffic)	187% of baseline	↑ 87% more views on average
Dwell Time on Page
novavirtualtours.com
snappr.com
Standard (e.g. 1x)	3× to 10× longer	3–10× longer time spent
User Saves/Favorites (Zillow)
inman.com
Baseline (100%)	160% of baseline	↑ 60% save rate
Lead Form Inquiries (Rentals)
planomatic.com
Baseline (no tour)	220% of baseline	↑ 120% more leads
These engagement gains underscore that 3D and interactive media make listings stand out in a crowded online marketplace
sjcmanagement.com
sjcmanagement.com
. When buyers can actively explore a property online, they feel more confident and invested – as a result, the listing generates more “clicks, looks and likes,” increasing the pool of interested prospects and ultimately improving the chance of a quicker sale or lease.
Conversion Rates and Buyer/Renter Decisions
Beyond views and clicks, the ultimate goal is converting interested parties into real tenants or buyers. Here’s how 3D tours have impacted conversion-related metrics:
Sight-Unseen Transactions: Virtual tours have dramatically increased consumers’ willingness to make offers or sign leases without an in-person visit. According to a nationwide survey, 50% of buyers said they would be willing to make an offer on a property based solely on a virtual tour if it provided enough information
photoup.net
. In practice, this started happening at scale in 2020: a Redfin survey of 1,900 homebuyers found 63% had made an offer on a home they hadn’t toured physically (double the rate of the previous year)
snappr.com
. On the rental side, a joint Zumper–Matterport survey reported 72% of renters would sign a lease on an apartment without a live visit as long as a 3D tour was available
inman.com
. This is a huge shift from the past, effectively expanding the market to remote customers (e.g. out-of-state movers, military, international clients) and boosting conversion chances. Landlords leveraging virtual tours have capitalized on this: 82% of those who used 3D walkthroughs were able to secure tenants entirely online (the renter applied, leased, and moved in without any in-person showing)
inman.com
. Such end-to-end digital leasing was nearly unheard of pre-3D technology.
Qualified Leads & Faster Deal Flow: Because virtual tours act as a “24/7 open house,” they tend to produce more qualified leads. Those who reach out after viewing a 3D tour are often already “sold” on the property’s layout and feel. Brokers report that buyers who engage with 3D media often make quicker decisions – in one example, adding immersive 3D tours and interactive floorplans led to a 50% reduction in time to receive an offer on listings (offers came in about twice as fast)
novavirtualtours.com
. Moreover, fall-through rates can decrease: when buyers virtually walk through a home multiple times beforehand, there are fewer surprises later, reducing the odds of cold feet. One realtor observed that contracts were less likely to collapse because the 3D tour had set realistic expectations, so buyers were more confident in their choice (no last-minute “this room is smaller than I thought” objections)
novavirtualtours.com
.
Higher Conversion Rates & Pricing Power: Interactive 3D content can also indirectly improve conversion by increasing a listing’s perceived value and reach. Sellers commonly believe these tools give them a competitive advantage – 99% of home sellers in one survey felt that a 3D tour would make their listing more competitive
photoup.net
, and 82% of sellers said they’d even switch to an agent who offers such technology
photoup.net
. This is because homes marketed with 3D tours have been shown to achieve higher offer prices in some cases. The Matterport MLS study found a lift of 4–9% in final sale price for listings with a 3D tour (controlling for other factors)
matterport.com
. Similarly, aggregated data in 2023 showed virtual-tour listings sold for about 9% more on average than those without tours
photoup.net
. In rentals, better visualization can justify higher rents: one platform found using professional photos + 3D tours enabled landlords to increase rent by ~10% per square foot due to higher-quality leads willing to pay a premium
planomatic.com
. While not every case will see a price premium, these tools often prevent under-valuing a property by showcasing its features fully, thus converting undecided shoppers into confident buyers willing to meet the asking price.
Demographic Trends: 3D tours particularly appeal to younger, tech-savvy audiences who are more likely to convert online. Buyers aged 18–34 are 130% more likely to book a showing if a listing includes a virtual tour, according to one study
photoup.net
. This demographic expects interactive media and may even skip listings that don’t have it. In fact, 54% of home buyers say they ignore listings that lack virtual tours
snappr.com
 – meaning sellers could be losing half their potential young buyers by not offering a 3D tour. On the rental side, the digital-native generation is very comfortable doing 100% online leasing. Property managers note that virtual tours, combined with online applications and e-signatures, have made “self-service” rentals possible – prospects often go from virtual tour to signed lease in a matter of hours, especially in fast-moving urban rental markets
globest.com
prnewswire.com
. This reduces the leasing cycle dramatically compared to the traditional sequence of scheduling showings, which can take days or weeks.
Qualitative Insights (3D vs. 2D Floorplans)
Case studies and agent feedback also shed light on why 3D interactive floorplans outperform traditional 2D methods:
Better Visualization: Unlike static 2D floorplans, a 3D interactive floorplan lets buyers virtually “walk” the layout. This helps eliminate uncertainty about how rooms connect or the true scale of spaces. In a Zillow consumer study, 69% of buyers said that a dynamic floor plan (interactive map with photos) was crucial in choosing the right home
virtuance.com
. Being able to click on a room in the floorplan and instantly see a 360° view of it provides context that plain 2D blueprints cannot. As one real estate marketer put it, “3D tours allow clients to feel like they are actually in the home,” which builds an emotional connection that motivates them to take the next step
virtuance.com
virtuance.com
.
Greater Trust and Transparency: High-quality 3D tours can build trust with buyers and renters. They can explore every corner, which assures them there is nothing to hide. This transparency can lead to higher conversion because prospects feel more confident that “what they see is what they’ll get.” Agents report fewer instances of disappointment during in-person visits. In rentals, this means applicants are less likely to back out upon seeing the unit. Virtual tours thus streamline the approval process – truly interested parties self-select, and those who were never serious are filtered out earlier
sjcmanagement.com
sjcmanagement.com
. Landlords also save time by not having to show the property to unqualified tenants who might have lost interest if they had seen the layout beforehand.
Competitive Differentiator: Using 3D and AR technology is a way for real estate professionals to stand out in the market. Properties marketed with interactive tours and virtual staging convey a modern, premium brand image. Nearly 3 out of 4 sellers say they are more likely to hire an agent who includes virtual tours or interactive floorplans in their services
boxbrownie.com
. This has led to wider adoption of these tools on platforms like Zillow, Redfin, and Trulia so as not to be left behind. As more listings include 3D tours, those that don’t may appear outdated. During the pandemic, 3D content went from a nice-to-have to essentially standard for higher-end listings, and that trend continues. For example, by late 2020, Zillow saw 750% growth in virtual tour usage right after stay-at-home orders, and usage remained about twice the pre-pandemic level through that year
snappr.com
. The industry recognizes that immersive content is here to stay as a **“new normal” in property marketing
novavirtualtours.com
.
Higher Quality Inquiries: Realtors often describe virtual tours as a tool that “sells the home for you” by the time the buyer actually visits. A well-known Matterport case study noted that even if final sale prices weren’t radically higher in every case post-COVID, agents still value virtual tours for the qualitative benefits – they attract more informed, serious buyers, shorten the negotiation process, and reduce the back-and-forth of showings
library.hbs.edu
library.hbs.edu
. In essence, the efficiency gains (fewer days showing the home, fewer open houses, smoother closings) are a major advantage. One Texas brokerage found that after adding 3D tours, not only did average DOM drop, but their sale price to list price ratio improved from 93% to 97% (fewer discounts needed)
matterport.com
. This suggests that immersive listings may face less buyer hesitation or haggling, because buyers feel more certain when they make an offer.
Conclusion
3D interactive floorplans and virtual tours have proven to be powerful tools in real estate marketing, often outperforming traditional 2D photos and floorplans on key metrics. They can reduce vacancy times by attracting more qualified prospects sooner – in many cases cutting days on market by double-digit percentages. They dramatically increase online engagement, driving higher click-through rates and keeping users engaged longer, which in turn yields more leads and potential buyers. Perhaps most importantly, they can improve conversion rates: more shoppers are willing to commit (place an offer or sign a lease) without an in-person visit, and those who do visit are often already sold on the property’s merits. That said, the effectiveness of 3D tours can vary by market and context. They tend to have the biggest impact when catering to remote or busy audiences, and during times when physical visits are difficult. In a post-pandemic normalizing market, a 3D tour by itself isn’t a guaranteed quick sale – pricing, property condition, and good 2D media still matter
library.hbs.edu
. But as part of a comprehensive marketing strategy, virtual tours and interactive floorplans are a highly effective enhancement. They provide an immersive experience that modern buyers and renters not only appreciate but increasingly expect. Real-world data from Zillow, Redfin, Matterport and others makes a strong case that these tools reduce the friction in real estate transactions, leading to faster deals and more satisfied clients in both the rental and home sales sectors.

Comparison of Virtual Design-Based vs. 3D Scan-Based Digital Twins in Real Estate Marketing
Introduction
Real estate marketers increasingly use 3D “digital twins” to showcase properties online. These come in two broad forms: (1) Virtual-design-based models created from scratch or floor plans (using tools like Room Planner, Planner 5D, Homestyler, Coohom), which allow agents or developers to virtually furnish or design spaces; and (2) Real-space scanned models (using platforms like Matterport, Zillow 3D Home, etc.) that capture an exact 3D walkthrough of the actual property via photogrammetry or LiDAR. Both approaches enhance visualization for remote buyers/renters, but their impact on marketing performance can differ. Below, we compare how each type influences key metrics – especially time on market (vacancy duration) and conversion rates – in the U.S. real estate and rental industry, citing available data and case studies.
Virtual Design-Based 3D Twins (3D Floor Plans & Virtual Staging)
What They Are: Virtual design tools let agents or consumers digitally recreate a property’s interior as a 3D model. Users can draw floor plans and add furniture or finishes to produce photorealistic images, 360° renders, or interactive tours of a space that might be empty, under construction, or simply in need of staging. For example, an unfurnished condo can be virtually staged with furniture in Homestyler, or a new development can be visualized in 3D using Coohom before it’s built. This type of digital twin is essentially a simulated vision of the property’s potential, rather than a direct capture of its current state. Impact on Buyer Visualization and Interest: By showcasing a furnished, well-designed version of a home, virtual staging and 3D floor plans make it easier for buyers to imagine themselves in the space. According to the National Association of Realtors, 81% of buyer agents said staging (including virtual staging) helps buyers visualize a property as a future home
virtualstaging.com
. This improved visualization translates into more clicks and inquiries. Listings that include floor plan visuals get significantly more engagement – one source notes that adding a floor plan can boost buyer click-through by about 52%
boxbrownie.com
, and 64% of home shoppers specifically look for floor plans on listings
boxbrownie.com
. In fact, a real estate study found 1 in 5 buyers will ignore a listing that lacks a floor plan, underscoring how crucial this content is for capturing interest
boxbrownie.com
. Time on Market (Vacancy Duration): Virtually designing or staging a property tends to reduce time on market by making the listing more appealing from the start. Data from multiple studies back this: A Coldwell Banker analysis in 2023 found virtually staged homes spent 24 days on market on average, versus 90 days for unstaged homes – a 73% faster sale for those with virtual staging
homejab.com
. Similarly, the Real Estate Staging Association (RESA) reported that homes staged before listing (often via either physical or virtual staging) sold in a median of just 23 days compared to 184 days for homes that were not staged – an enormous difference
homejab.com
. Even on a broader scale, staging helps trim the selling timeline: nearly half (48%) of sellers’ agents in a 2023 NAR survey observed decreased time on market with staging interventions
virtualstaging.com
. In monetary terms, Redfin found that vacant (unstaged) homes not only took longer to sell but ultimately sold for $11k less on average than comparable occupied/staged homes
virtualstaging.com
 – indicating that an empty, unfurnished space both slows down a sale and may force a price cut. By virtually filling an empty home with attractive furniture and decor, agents can quickly overcome the “vacant home” penalty and hit the market with a compelling presentation, often cutting out weeks or months of vacancy time. Conversion and Sales Outcomes: Better visualization through virtual design can lead to higher-quality leads and more conversions. Because buyers can see the potential of the home online, they are more likely to take the next step (such as scheduling a showing or even making an offer). According to a RE/MAX study, listings with professional virtual staging saw 74% more interest from serious buyers and 45% fewer time-wasting inquiries from folks who weren’t truly interested
homejab.com
. This means virtual design tools help filter in the right prospects, potentially boosting the conversion rate of inquiries-to-offers. There’s also evidence of price uplifts and ROI due to virtual staging: one analysis by Sotheby’s found virtually staged homes sold for about 6–10% more than unstaged ones on average
homejab.com
. While every situation varies, nearly half of buyer agents (44%) have reported that staged listings (including virtual) received higher offers from buyers compared to unstaged properties
virtualstaging.com
. All of these factors – more serious interest, better perceived value, and faster engagement – contribute to a greater likelihood of converting online interest into a signed contract. In practice, agents often find that a relatively small investment in virtual staging (often only ~$20–50 per photo) yields huge ROI (500–3600%) in the form of a quicker sale at a higher price
homejab.com
. Use in Rentals: In rental marketing, virtual design tools can be used to pre-lease units in new developments or to advertise vacant apartments with virtual furniture. For instance, a property manager might use Planner 5D or Coohom to create a 3D walkthrough of a model unit to show tenants how a one-bedroom could look furnished. This can reduce vacancy by attracting renters faster, though quantitative data is sparser than in home sales. Anecdotally, landlords report that virtually staged rental listings “feel” more inviting and can drive up inquiries. The effect is similar to sales: a well-presented space (even if virtually decorated) tends to rent out faster than an empty, lifeless one. Transparency is key: best practice is to label virtually staged images so renters aren’t misled when they tour an empty unit in person
homejab.com
. In scenarios like pre-construction leasing, virtual models are the only option – here, design-based digital twins are absolutely critical for conversion, as they enable “leasing from blueprints” by letting renters virtually walk through the planned space (often leading to signed leases before a building is even finished).
Real-Space 3D Scan-Based Digital Twins (Immersive 3D Tours)
What They Are: Scan-based digital twins are created by capturing the real property with special cameras or scanners. A platform like Matterport uses 360° cameras and depth sensors to scan the actual home, generating an interactive walkthrough (often called a 3D virtual tour) that anyone online can navigate. Other solutions (e.g., Zillow 3D Home or iGuide) similarly stitch together panoramas of the real space. The result is a photorealistic, true-to-scale model of the property’s current condition, sometimes nicknamed a “24/7 virtual open house”
matterport.com
. These tours let remote buyers look in every corner of a home as if they were there, offering an accurate sense of layout and flow that static photos can’t provide. In the rental world, many apartment communities and single-family rental operators now use 3D scans to let prospects tour units online. Nearly 58% of buyers say they want to see virtual tours when shopping for homes
photoup.net
, and sellers are responding – about 60% of home sellers in 2023 said a virtual tour is “very or extremely important” to include in their listing
zillow.com
. Impact on Engagement: Real 3D tours are proven to dramatically boost online engagement with listings. Because the experience is interactive and informative, buyers tend to spend more time and come back more often. Realtor.com data shows that listings with a virtual tour receive 87% more views on average than those without
photoup.net
. Zillow observed a similar trend on their platform: for-sale listings with a Zillow 3D Home tour get 50% more saves (favorites) from shoppers than listings without a 3D tour
wp-tid.zillowstatic.com
. This indicates buyers are not only clicking these listings more, but also bookmarking them at a higher rate – a strong sign of interest. Moreover, potential buyers spend 5 to 10 times longer on real estate websites when exploring a virtual tour, compared to sites with photos alone
photoup.net
. Vacation rental manager Vacasa reported that guests browse Matterport 3D tour listings 3× longer than listings with just photos
matterport.com
. All this extra engagement means more opportunities for a lead to convert – by the time a buyer finishes a thorough 3D walkthrough, they are often “sold” enough on the home’s features to reach out to the agent. Time on Market Reduction: By widening the pool of interested buyers (including out-of-town movers or those unable to visit immediately) and providing rich information up front, scanned 3D tours tend to accelerate the sales/leasing process. A study of MLS data across multiple U.S. markets found that listings with a 3D tour (mostly Matterport) closed up to 31% faster on average, controlling for other factors
matterport.com
matterport.com
. In one metropolitan dataset, homes with a Matterport digital twin spent about 20% fewer days on market than similar homes without a 3D tour
matterport.com
. Real-world brokerage results echo this: for example, a Texas brokerage (Real Estate by Design) saw their average DOM drop from 30 days to 21 days after adopting Matterport 3D tours on all their listings
matterport.com
matterport.com
. That’s a 9-day improvement, which in a competitive market can be significant. In the rental sector, the impact on vacancy days is also clear. PlanOmatic (a vendor for 3D tours and floor plans) partnered with an SFR investor to measure results on Zillow Rentals: properties with a 3D tour had a 30% shorter vacancy period on Zillow compared to those with photos only
planomatic.com
. This study also noted a major uptick in lead volume (discussed below) accompanying the faster lease-up. Overall, by giving remote prospects the confidence to act quickly, virtual tours prevent extended time on market. It effectively keeps the listing from “going stale,” since interested parties can take action sooner without waiting to schedule an in-person viewing. Conversion Rates and Sight-Unseen Transactions: Perhaps the biggest advantage of 3D scanned twins is how they enable “conversion without physical presence.” Buyers and renters are far more willing to sign a contract sight-unseen if they have toured a faithful digital replica of the home. During the pandemic, these tools became essential – nearly half of buyers in one 2020 survey said they would make an offer on a property based only on a virtual tour if they liked it
photoup.net
, and 63% of buyers who purchased in 2020 actually made an offer without visiting in person, using virtual tours instead
photoup.net
. Even in 2023, renters show a similar trend: Matterport’s rental consumer survey found 71% of renters would sign a lease sight-unseen if a 3D tour is available
matterport.com
. This directly boosts conversion rates by removing geographical and scheduling barriers. The Dallas brokerage mentioned earlier went from only a few “sight-unseen” deals a year to routinely closing sales completely virtually after adding 3D tours
matterport.com
matterport.com
. On the leasing side, PlanOmatic’s study on Zillow Rentals found that adding 3D tours led to 35% more lease applications per property, indicating a higher conversion of interested prospects into actual applicants
planomatic.com
. Vacasa, for instance, saw a 12% increase in booking conversion rate on rental listings that included a Matterport tour, compared to those without
matterport.com
matterport.com
. In addition to more people willing to convert remotely, there’s evidence that 3D tours attract more qualified leads: many tire-kickers self-select out after virtually walking through a home, while truly interested buyers move forward. This aligns with the earlier stat that a good virtual tour can reduce frivolous inquiries – one survey noted 54% of buyers won’t even consider a home if it lacks a virtual tour, meaning those who do call you after viewing the tour are likely serious
photoup.net
. Overall, scan-based digital twins excel at driving remote conversions and speeding up the deal cycle, from online viewing to signed contract. Impact on Price and ROI: While the primary goal here is faster marketing, it’s worth noting effects on sale price. Matterport’s own analysis (pre-pandemic) suggested homes with 3D tours could sell for a modest 4–9% higher price than those without
matterport.com
. Other aggregated data in 2025 showed a similar ~9% average sale price increase for homes marketed with virtual tours
photoup.net
. However, academic research offers a nuanced view: a 2023 Harvard study of 75,000 home sales found that when controlling for high-quality photos and descriptions, simply adding a 3D tour didn’t significantly raise final sale prices and in some cases slightly lengthened DOM in post-pandemic conditions
library.hbs.edu
library.hbs.edu
. The researcher concluded that virtual tours alone aren’t a magic bullet for price, but they may help in other ways – for example, by satisfying buyer curiosity and reducing the need for multiple showings, or by enabling deals that otherwise wouldn’t happen (such as long-distance purchases)
library.hbs.edu
library.hbs.edu
. Many agents still report that having a 3D tour gives them a competitive edge to win listings, even if the direct price lift is small. In fact, 99% of home sellers believe a 3D tour gives their property a competitive advantage in marketing
photoup.net
, and 82% of sellers said they would switch to an agent who offers immersive 3D tours and virtual plans
photoup.net
. This suggests that sellers see enough value in these tools (for speeding up sales and improving buyer experience) to factor it into whom they hire.

Best-Fit Use Cases for Each Approach
Both virtual-design and scanned 3D twins contribute to better marketing, but each shines in different scenarios:
Pre-Construction or Renovation – Use Virtual Design Twins. When a property doesn’t yet exist physically (new developments, off-plan condos) or is gutted for renovation, you can’t scan what isn’t built. Virtual design tools (like Planner 5D or Coohom) are ideal here to create a believable model of the future property. Developers use these to pre-sell units, giving buyers a way to “walk through” and even customize finishes before construction is done. Similarly, for a fixer-upper home, an agent might include virtual renderings of a “renovated” kitchen or an alternate floor plan to help buyers envision the home’s potential beyond its current state – an effective strategy to drive interest in what could otherwise be a hard sell.
Vacant or Poorly Furnished Homes – Use Virtual Staging (Design) and/or Combine with Scans. Empty homes tend to feel cold and smaller in photos, hurting buyer emotion. Virtual staging can quickly insert stylish furniture to make the property feel move-in ready, boosting its appeal without the cost of real staging. For marketing, agents often provide virtually staged photos alongside an actual 3D tour of the empty space (or even now, some platforms allow virtual staging within a 3D scan). This combo gives the best of both worlds: accuracy and inspiration. Virtual design is also helpful for luxury properties where you want to show multiple interior style options – e.g. a home office could also be shown as a nursery – by easily swapping decor in software. In contrast, a Matterport scan alone would only show the home in its single current state. Thus, virtual design tools excel at presenting alternate visions of a space tailored to different audiences.
Occupied or Fully Built Homes (Especially with Nice Interiors) – Use Real 3D Scans. When a home is already nicely furnished or is a newly completed model home, doing a real 3D scan can capture all its details and true proportions authentically. This is great for existing home sales: the buyer can virtually tour the actual property they’ll buy, which builds trust. It’s also suitable for rental units in inventory (e.g., an apartment layout that you have multiple units of) – one scan can be reused to lease out many identical units by showing prospects exactly what the unit type looks like. Scans are particularly powerful for showcasing unique layouts or large houses where static photos might miss the flow; a 3D tour ensures no room or feature is left unseen, which can be the clincher for someone abroad or out of state. Essentially, use scan-based twins when you want to emphasize the property’s current reality (because it’s appealing as is) and allow full transparency.
Remote Buyers or Renters & “Sight-Unseen” Situations – Lean on Real 3D Tours. If your target market includes investors purchasing from another city, relocating families, or renters moving from out-of-town, a Matterport or similar tour is almost a must. It provides the assurance of an accurate depiction – critical for someone who may sign a contract without a physical visit. Virtual design content (rendered images) is still useful as a supplement, but remote clients usually demand a scanned tour to feel comfortable. For example, a military family renting a home cross-country will likely prefer a real 3D walkthrough over a purely computer-modeled tour, to ensure they see the actual wear-and-tear and room dimensions.
Marketing Budget and Turnaround – Virtual Design is cheaper/faster; Scans are more turn-key. If budget is very tight or timing is critical, virtual design might be more accessible. Taking a Matterport scan typically requires a special camera and a few hours on-site, plus processing time; by contrast, a virtual staging company can turn around staged photos in <48 hours for a few hundred dollars or less
homejab.com
. A realtor who wants to stand out on a shoestring budget might opt for virtual staging of key rooms and a Zillow 3D tour shot on an iPhone (lower cost alternative to Matterport). On the other hand, large brokerages and property managers often integrate both: they’ll get a professional 3D scan for the immersive tour, and use those scan snapshots to virtually stage images, creating a polished package. The choice often comes down to what assets are already available (if you have a physical staged model, scan it; if you have only a floor plan, render it) and the expectations of the target audience.
Conclusion
In summary, both types of 3D digital twin technology have proven to boost real estate marketing performance by making listings more informative and engaging. Virtual design-based tools shine when you need to show possibilities – they excel at pre-construction marketing and giving life to empty spaces, which in turn leads to faster sales (often cutting days on market by half or more) and can increase the perceived value of the property. They’re cost-effective and flexible, allowing multiple style iterations that can attract a wider range of buyers. Real-space 3D scans shine at showing reality with convenience – they build trust and attract a larger audience of remote or busy buyers, often resulting in a quicker sale or lease (20–30% faster on average) and a higher conversion of online views into actual deals (as evidenced by double-digit increases in leads, applications, and sight-unseen transactions). Importantly, these technologies are not mutually exclusive – many successful campaigns use virtual staging in tandem with 3D tours, and platforms are evolving to merge the two (for example, Matterport has introduced AI tools to virtually remove or add furniture within scans). The choice of one over the other often depends on the use case: for a non-existent or unfinished space, virtual rendering is the only option, whereas for an existing property, a real 3D tour provides authenticity (augmented by virtual staging if needed). In the U.S. market, where Zillow and Redfin now highlight 3D Home tours and interactive floor plans, consumers have come to expect a richer digital experience – in fact, 75% of buyers say virtual tours are a major factor in their decision
photoup.net
. Both virtual design and scan-based twins deliver that richer experience, reducing vacancy periods and boosting conversion rates in their own ways. The data shows that adopting these tools is less about if they help (they do) and more about when and how to deploy each for maximum impact. By playing to each approach’s strengths, real estate professionals can significantly improve marketing outcomes – filling listings faster and converting online interest into signed contracts more effectively than traditional photos alone.

planomatic.com
. These illustrate the tangible gains (in reduced days-on-market, increased engagement, and higher lead-to-deal conversion) achieved by leveraging both virtual design tools and 3D scanning technology in property marketing. Each toolset has distinct advantages, and understanding their efficacy helps agents, developers, and leasing professionals choose the right digital twin strategy for their specific needs.

3d Twin Ceo Report

3D 디지털 트윈 기술이 미국 부동산 시장에 미치는 영향과 전략적 활용 방안
부동산 시장에서 효과적인 온라인 마케팅은 계약 전환율과 공실 기간(vacancy rate)을 크게 좌우하는 핵심 요인이 되고 있습니다. 최근 미국 시장에서는 가상 설계형(Virtual Design-Based) 3D 모델링(예: Room Planner, Planner 5D, Homestyler, Coohom)과 실제 공간을 3D로 스캔한 현실 기반(Scan-Based) 디지털 트윈(예: Matterport, Zillow 3D Home)이 폭넓게 사용되고 있으며, 각각의 성과를 분석한 결과를 보고합니다.

1. 가상 설계형 디지털 트윈(Virtual Design-Based)
가상 설계형 디지털 트윈은 빈 공간을 가상으로 꾸며 시각적으로 매력적인 이미지를 제공합니다. 이는 특히 미완공 또는 비어있는 부동산을 마케팅할 때 효과적입니다.

공실 기간 단축 효과:

가상 스테이징을 한 부동산은 평균 24일 내에 계약이 체결되어, 스테이징하지 않은 부동산(평균 90일) 대비 약 73% 빠르게 판매되었습니다(관련 연구 링크).

사전 스테이징된 부동산의 시장 체류 기간은 평균 23일로, 미스테이징된 부동산(184일) 대비 현저히 짧습니다.

계약 전환율 및 가격 프리미엄:

가상 스테이징은 구매자의 실질적 관심도를 74% 높이고, 캐주얼한 문의는 45% 감소시켜 더욱 효율적인 계약 전환을 유도합니다.

가상 스테이징된 부동산은 평균적으로 6~10% 더 높은 가격에 거래되었으며, 투자 대비 수익률(ROI)은 최대 3600%로 나타났습니다(관련 연구 링크).

2. 현실 기반 스캔형 디지털 트윈(Scan-Based)
실제 공간을 스캔한 디지털 트윈은 높은 정확성과 신뢰성을 제공합니다. 이는 원격에서 부동산을 계약하는 고객에게 특히 효과적입니다.

공실 기간 단축 효과:

Matterport와 같은 실제 스캔 3D 투어를 활용한 부동산은 기존 방식 대비 평균적으로 20~31% 더 빠르게 계약이 성사되었습니다(Matterport 케이스 스터디).

Zillow Rentals에서 3D 투어를 포함한 임대 매물의 공실 기간이 30% 감소했습니다.

계약 전환율 및 고객 인게이지먼트:

실제 3D 투어가 제공되는 매물은 평균적으로 조회수가 87% 더 높으며, 사용자가 해당 사이트에 머무르는 시간이 5~10배 증가했습니다(Realtor.com 조사 결과).

원격 계약(온라인으로만 매물을 확인한 후 계약)이 가능한 고객 비율이 높아져 구매 및 임대 계약률이 상당히 증가했습니다(약 63%의 구매자가 방문 없이 온라인으로 계약 체결).

두 유형의 전략적 활용 방안
미완공 및 리노베이션 대상 매물:

가상 설계형 디지털 트윈이 가장 적합하며, 고객에게 건축 중인 공간의 가능성을 명확하게 전달하여 사전 계약을 유도할 수 있습니다.

기존 매물 및 원격 고객 대상:

현실 기반 3D 스캔은 이미 구축된 공간의 정확한 정보를 전달하여 원격 구매자의 신뢰를 높이고 빠른 계약 체결을 돕습니다.

복합적 활용 방안:

최근에는 두 방식을 결합한 전략이 각광받고 있습니다. 예를 들어 현실 기반의 정확한 3D 스캔 위에 가상 스테이징을 추가하면 현실감과 감성적 요소를 동시에 전달할 수 있습니다.

결론 및 전략 제안
두 가지 디지털 트윈 기술 모두 공실 기간 단축과 계약 전환율 향상에 분명한 효과가 있습니다. 각 기술의 특성을 이해하고 이를 전략적으로 혼합하여 활용하면 마케팅 효율성을 극대화할 수 있을 것입니다. 앞으로 부동산 마케팅 전략 수립 시, 이 두 가지 방식을 상황에 맞게 적극 도입하는 방안을 추천합니다.
