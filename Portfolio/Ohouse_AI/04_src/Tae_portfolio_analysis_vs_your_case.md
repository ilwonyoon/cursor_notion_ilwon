# Tae's Sr. Staff PM Portfolio Analysis vs Your Ohouse AI Case

## Executive Summary

Tae is a Sr. Staff Product Design Manager at Meta (L7) who was previously Head of UX at Google News. His portfolio demonstrates proven large-scale leadership. Your Ohouse AI case has equally strong **ingredients** but needs to emphasize:

1. **Scale & Impact Metrics** (concrete numbers)
2. **Strategic Rationale** (Why this decision over alternatives)
3. **Failed Experiments** (Learning velocity)

---

## 1. Structure & Narrative Arc

### Tae's Portfolio Structure: 3-Act Pattern

**Act 1: Introduction & Context (5%)**
- Titles: Meta L7, Instagram L7, Google Head of UX
- Establishes credibility immediately

**Act 2: Google News Case Study (60%)**
- Problem definition (Industry-level framing)
- Strategic vision
- Execution details
- Results with metrics

**Act 3: Leadership Philosophy & External Validation (30%)**
- XFN partnership principles
- Design system contributions
- Speaking/conference presence

### Problem → Decision → Execution → Results Flow

**Tae's Pattern:**

```
Problem: "Three main challenges: Noise at all time high / Trust at all time low / Revenue in peril"
↓
Strategic Vision: "Build a news ecosystem that is trusted, sustainable and enjoyable"
↓
Execution:
  - Reimagined Google News for mobile-first + AI
  - 4 main surfaces (Home IA)
  - International expansion (Translate Everything)
  - Special Experiences (World Cup, Grammys, Oscars)
  - Publisher Center (ecosystem play)
↓
Results:
  - User: 17M/147M DAU/MAU, 9.4-16.2 min engagement
  - Business: 1.4B article views/day, 30% highly engaged
  - Quality: 4+ ratings, Material Design Award Winner
```

### "What" vs "Why + How + Impact" Ratio

**Tae's Distribution:**
- What: 20% (visual only - screenshots)
- Why: 30% (strategic rationale + customer insight)
- How: 30% (organizational change + partnerships)
- Impact: 20% (metrics + qualitative evidence)

**Key Insight:** Tae shows "What" visually, but explains "Why/How/Impact" through narrative.

Example: "75% of DAUs international, 40%+ multilingual" → This **WHY** Translate Everything is critical

### Part Depth Variation

| Section | Depth | Focus |
|---------|-------|-------|
| Introduction | Shallow | Credibility establishment |
| Google News Case | Deep | All dimensions (problem, strategy, execution, results) |
| Leadership Principles | Moderate | System-level thinking |
| External Validation | Shallow | Authority in field |

---

## 2. Metrics & Evidence Strategy

### Types of Evidence Tae Uses

**1. Product Metrics (Quantitative)**
- DAU: 17M
- MAU: 147M
- Engagement: 9.4 min (global), 16.2 min (US)
- Scale: 1.4B article views/day
- Feature adoption: 45% played at least 1 song (Grammys)

### Failures Explicitly Included

**"And Fails..." section:**
- Android TV (failed)
- Apple Watch (failed)
- Vacation Mode (failed)

**Framing:** Henry Ford quote - "Failure is simply the opportunity to begin again, this time more intelligently."

**Message:** Risk-taking + learning mindset demonstrated

### Leadership Credibility Evidence

| Dimension | How Demonstrated |
|-----------|------------------|
| **Team Development** | "Less is more: focus on 80% high priority / 20% excellence" |
| **Org Influence** | "UX ownership changed" (gate-keeping without direct authority) |

## 4. Your Ohouse AI vs Tae's Case: Direct Comparison

### What You Already Have (Strengths)

| Element | Your Case | Tae's Case | Comparison |
|---------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| **Strategic Insight** | "visualization ≠ execution" | "noise/trust/revenue crisis" | Both industry-level reframing ✅ |
| **C-level Buy-in** | Data infra investment approved | I/O keynote feature | Both executive-level validation ✅ |
| **Early Signal** | 50% conversion (rendered products) | 45% adoption (song plays) | Similar early validation ✅ |
| **Org Impact** | Full team → AI-empowered IC | UX ownership changed | Both structural transformation ✅ |
| **Vision + Prototype** | Video prototypes ready | Screenshots + narrative | Yours arguably better ✅ |

### Critical Gaps: What Tae Has That You Don't (Yet)

#### **Gap 1: Scale & Scope Metrics**

**Tae:** "127 countries, 147M MAU, 1.4B article views/day"

**You:** "~50% conversion" ❓

**What's missing:**
- Absolute user count (500 users? 50K users?)
- Time period (1 week? 1 month? 1 quarter?)
- Baseline comparison (Previous: X%?)
- Revenue impact ($X annual if scaled?)

**Why it matters:**
- "50%" could be meaningful (500 users) or noise (5 users)
- Tier 0 evaluates: "Did you prove this works **at scale**?"

**What you need:**
```
Pilot: 500 users, 4 weeks
Result: 50% conversion (vs 15% baseline)
Impact: If scaled to 100K users = $X annual revenue
```

#### **Gap 2: Strategic Rationale Depth**

**Tae's Why:**
```
Industry Problem → Company Mission → Product Strategy → Feature Details
(Noise at all time high) → (Build trusted ecosystem) → (Personalized news) → (Home IA, Translate)
```

**Your Why:**
```
Room Planner revealed visualization gap → AI can solve it
```

**What's missing:**
- Industry context ("Home interior e-commerce converts at X%, Ohouse at Y%")
- Why NOW? ("AI personalization proven in fashion/retail, not yet home")
- Competitive landscape ("Competitors X, Y do this but not Z")
- Strategic alternatives considered ("Why AI agents vs templates vs more designers?")

**What you need:**
- "Home interior market: $X billion, avg conversion Y%, Ohouse Z%"
- "Why 2024? AI cost dropped X%, accuracy improved Y%"
- "Alternatives: (1) Hire designers - cost $X, scale limit Y (2) Templates - 20% match rate (3) AI agents - selected"

#### **Gap 3: Organizational Change Evidence**

**Tae:**
- Visual chart: "OKRs ownership: 2018 (PM+ENG) → 2019 (PM+ENG+UX)"
- Clear before/after

**You:**
- "Full team → AI-empowered IC" (stated, not shown)

**What's missing:**
- Specific numbers ("Before: 6 designers, After: 1 designer + AI")
- Timeline ("2024 Q1 → Q4")
- Outcome metrics ("Output: 2/week → 100/day")
- Team redeployment ("5 designers moved to: X, Y, Z")
- Process changes ("From manual design → AI agent training/curation")

**What you need:**
```
Before (Q1 2024):
- Team: 6 designers
- Output: 2-3 room designs/week
- Iteration: 2 weeks

After (Q4 2024):
- Team: 1 designer + AI infrastructure
- Output: 100+ personalized designs/day
- Iteration: 3 days per model update

Team redeployed:
- 2 → AR/VR
- 2 → Mobile redesign
- 1 → Design system lead
```

#### **Gap 4: Failed Experiments**

**Tae:** Explicitly listed (Android TV, Apple Watch, Vacation Mode)

**You:** ❓

**What's missing:**
- Any documented failures?
- Learning velocity evidence

**Why it matters:**
- Failures = risk-taking = leadership
- No failures = playing it safe = insufficient leadership signal

**What you need:**
```
Tried: Fully automated design
Failed: 68% user rejection (felt impersonal)
Learned: Always show 3 options, explain trade-offs

Tried: Real-time 3D rendering
Failed: 12s load time on mobile
Learned: Pre-render library + dynamic combinations

Tried: Async feedback loop
Failed: 5-day delay, users lost context
Learned: Daily 15-min sync with users critical
```

#### **Gap 5: Cross-functional Partnership Details**

**Tae:** "Super tight XFN partnership", "Design Sprint + Daily sync"

**You:** "C-level buy-in" (result only, no process)

**What's missing:**
- Who did you work with?
- How did you build alignment?
- What were the key decisions made together?
- How did you overcome disagreements?

**What you need:**
```
Key Partnerships:
- Data Science: Built product matching model (3-month iteration)
- PM: Decided pricing strategy for AI features
- Engineering: Designed scalable inference architecture
- C-suite: Weekly progress syncs, presented risks & investment needs

Key Decision:
- Challenge: "Is this too expensive for users?"
- Response: "Pilot showed 50% conversion → $X LTV, justifies cost"
- Result: Approved continued investment
```

## 5. "Show but Don't Tell" Structure Assessment

### Your Structure

**Part 1:** Video prototype (Ohouse vs Ohouse AI)
**Part 2:** Strategic rationale + C-level challenges + Q&A prep

### Comparison to Tae's Approach

| Dimension | Tae | You | Assessment |
|-----------|-----|-----|-----------|
| **Visual** | Screenshots only | Video prototype | You're stronger ✅ |
| **Narrative Flow** | Problem → Vision → Execution → Results | Separate sections | Tae's is more integrated |
| **Evidence integration** | Metrics right after visuals | Separated in Part 2 | Better to integrate |
| **Failure transparency** | Explicit "And Fails" slide | TBD | You need this |

### The Risk

**If Part 1 is all "show" without immediate evidence:**
- Viewers think: "Cool! But so what?"
- Missing: Why this matters

**If Part 2 is all text-heavy narrative:**
- Viewers might not read thoroughly
- Missing: Visual proof

### Recommendation

**Hybrid approach:**

**Part 1:**
1. Video: Before/After experience (Ohouse → Ohouse AI)
2. Immediately after: **"50% conversion in pilot"** (big, visual)
3. Supporting: "Why this matters" (1-2 sentences)

**Part 2:**
1. Strategic narrative (Why you made this decision)
2. **Charts/data** (Before/After numbers)
3. Learning & failures
4. Q&A prep

**This way:**
- ✅ Vision catches attention (Part 1 video)
- ✅ Proof validates vision (Part 1 metrics)
- ✅ Strategic depth builds credibility (Part 2 narrative)
- ✅ Failures show maturity (Part 2 learning)

## 7. Action Items Priority (What to Do Next)

### Priority 1: Scale & Impact Metrics (Do This First - This Week)

**Current State:**
- "~50% conversion"

**What You Need:**
```
Ohouse AI Pilot Results:
- Participants: 500 users
- Duration: 4 weeks (Nov 1 - Nov 30, 2024)
- Conversion Rate: 50% (vs 15% Ohouse baseline)
- Revenue Impact: $X per purchase, Y purchases total = $Z pilot revenue
- If Scaled: 100K monthly users × 50% = 50K purchases × $X = $M annual

User Satisfaction:
- NPS: X
- Match satisfaction: 4.5/5 stars
- Quote: "This is exactly what I needed"
```

**Why:**
- Without numbers, "50%" is meaningless
- Tier 0 evaluates: "Did you prove this **actually works**?"

**How:**
1. Meeting with data/analytics team (1 hour)
2. Get access to: user count, conversion metrics, revenue impact
3. Calculate: "If scaled to full user base"
4. Format: Create simple visual (chart) showing Before/After

**Success:** You can say "X users, Y% conversion, $Z impact"

---

### Priority 2: Strategic Decision Narrative (Do Next Week)

**Current State:**
- "Got C-level buy-in"

**What You Need:**
```
Strategic Decision Memo: AI-Powered Agentic Design

Why This Problem:
- Home interior e-commerce: avg 10-15% conversion
- Ohouse current: 15% (stuck)
- But visualization tools up → buyers still can't decide
- Root cause: "Visualization ≠ confidence to buy"

Why Now:
- AI personalization proven: Fashion (Stitch Fix +X%), Retail (Amazon +Y%)
- But not yet in interior → first-mover advantage
- Cost of inference dropped Z% in 2024

Strategic Alternatives Considered:
1. Hire more designers
   - Cost: $X/year (6 designers)
   - Output: 2-3 designs/week
   - Scale limit: Bounded by team size
   - Verdict: Doesn't scale globally

2. Template-based tool
   - Fast to build
   - But: Generic, low match rate (20%)
   - Verdict: Doesn't solve "confidence" problem

3. AI-powered agentic design (SELECTED)
   - Personalized for each user
   - Scalable (not bounded by team)
   - Higher match rate (50% early evidence)
   - Verdict: Solves "confidence" AND scales

Key Trade-offs:
- Investment: $X data infrastructure
- Risk: "What if AI feels generic?"
- Mitigation: Pilot proved 50% conversion vs 15% baseline

C-Level Challenge & Response:
Q: "Why not just hire more designers?"
A: "One designer + AI infrastructure = outcomes of full team, scales to every user globally"

Q: "How do we know AI won't feel generic?"
A: "Pilot with 500 users: 50% conversion rate (3.3x baseline)"

Q: "What's the revenue impact?"
A: "If scaled: $X annual, Y% margin improvement"
```

**Why:**
- Shows **strategic thinking**, not just execution
- Demonstrates **conviction** (why you chose this over alternatives)
- Builds **credibility** (you've thought through objections)

**How:**
1. Write 1-pager: "Strategic Options for Room Planner Gap"
2. Document: What you considered, why you chose AI
3. Include: C-level Q&A from actual pitch (if you recorded/remember)

**Success:** Someone reads this and says "I see exactly why you made this decision"

---

### Priority 3: Failed Experiments Documentation (Do in 2 Weeks)

**Current State:**
- No documented failures

**What You Need:**
```
What We Tried (But Didn't Work)

1. Fully Automated Design
   - Approach: User input → AI generates design (no human curation)
   - Result: 68% user rejection rate (felt impersonal, no choice)
   - Learning: Users want agency. Show 3 options, explain trade-offs
   - Applied: Current system always shows alternatives

2. Real-Time 3D Rendering
   - Approach: Render room instantly as products added
   - Result: 12-second load time on mobile (too slow)
   - Learning: Pre-computation > real-time when experience matters
   - Applied: Pre-render library + dynamic recombination

3. Fully Autonomous Feedback Loop
   - Approach: Users provide feedback via text; AI iterates
   - Result: 5-day loop cycle (users forgot context)
   - Learning: Synchronous feedback > async when trust-building
   - Applied: Daily 15-min sync with power users

4. One-Size-Fits-All Recommendation
   - Approach: Best design for room type (not personalized)
   - Result: 35% match rate (users: "Doesn't match my style")
   - Learning: Personalization > generic even with good taste
   - Applied: Style vectors per user + preference learning
```

**Why:**
- Failures = risk-taking = leadership
- No failures = didn't push boundaries
- Tier 0 cares about: **Learning velocity**, not perfect execution

**How:**
1. Team retrospective: "What didn't work?"
2. For each: Document what, why, and what you changed
3. Include: Specific metrics (rejection rate, load time, cycle time)
4. Frame: "We learned X from this failure"

**Success:** 3-5 concrete failures documented with metrics

---

| **Industry context** | Implicit (Google) | ❌ | P2: Add context |
| **External validation** | Awards, keynotes | ❌ | Later: If applicable |

---

## 9. Next Steps - Exact Action Plan

### This Week (Priority 1)

**Task: Get Exact Metrics**

1. **15-min meeting with analytics:**
   - "I need pilot data for Ohouse AI agentic design feature"
   - Ask: User count, conversion rate, date range, revenue
   - Ask: Previous baseline for comparison
   - Ask: "If we scaled this to full 100K monthly users, what's projected revenue?"

2. **Create simple 1-slide metric:**
   ```
   Pilot: 500 users, 4 weeks (Nov 1-30, 2024)
   Conversion: 50% (vs 15% Ohouse baseline)
   Revenue: $X per transaction, $Y total pilot revenue
   If Scaled: $Z annual (at 100K users/month)
   ```

3. **Validate with stakeholder:**
   - Share with PM/data person
   - Confirm numbers are defensible

### Next Week (Priority 2A)

**Task: Write Strategic Rationale**

1. **1-pager: "Why AI-Powered Agentic Design?"**
   - Industry context (market, baseline, opportunity)
   - Why now (AI cost, accuracy, timing)
   - Alternatives considered
   - Trade-offs & how you addressed concerns
   - C-level Q&A

2. **Format:**
   - 2-3 pages max
   - Include: Before/After comparison chart (team, output, metrics)

### Following Week (Priority 2B)

**Task: Document Failures**

1. **Brainstorm with team:**
   - "What did we try that didn't work?"
   - 3-5 examples minimum

2. **For each failure:**
   - What you tried
   - Why it failed (metric)
   - What you learned
   - How you changed approach

### 2 Weeks After (Priority 3)

**Task: Integrate into Portfolio**

1. **Part 1:** Video prototype + metrics immediately after
2. **Part 2:** Strategic narrative + organizational change before/after + failures
3. **Part 3:** Q&A prep (anticipate "How did you convince C-level?")

---

## 10. Key Insight for You

**Tae proves:** Large-scale proven leader (Global, Scale)

**You will prove:** Transformational leader at inflection point (AI, Growth, Risk)

**Tier 0 (Anthropic, OpenAI, Figma) needs your type more.**

They don't need another person who can manage Google-scale. They need someone who can:
- Recognize when **medium changes** (from deterministic design to probabilistic AI design)
- **Re-architect teams** for AI era (full team → AI-empowered IC)
- **Take calculated risks** and learn from failures
- **Drive C-level** decisions with incomplete data

You have all of this. You just need to **articulate it clearly with proof points.**

Focus on:
1. **Metrics** (proof it works)
2. **Rationale** (proof you thought strategically)
3. **Failures** (proof you learned and iterated)

Then you have a case study **stronger than Tae's for Tier 0 hiring.**
