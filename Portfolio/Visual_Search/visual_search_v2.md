## **Visual Search — Shifting from Tag Quantity to Discovery Confidence**

**A strategic UX initiative to transition product discovery from manual tags to AI-driven personalization, led by Product Design in partnership with Content, Search, and ML teams.**

---

### **Problem**

By 2023, Ohouse's product discovery depended on manual product tags — small "+" icons overlaid on community photos.
While effective for short-term GMV, this model had reached critical limits:

Users faced **visual noise** (1-20+ tags per photo), making it harder to quickly identify products relevant to their own spaces.
Creators experienced high drop-off during tag upload, limiting content growth.
The Content team's KPIs (tag CTR, GMV attribution) conflicted with long-term UX improvements, creating organizational gridlock.

User research revealed the core issue: **users wanted to efficiently find products that fit their spaces**, but our solution—adding more tags—actually made the problem worse. We were optimizing for tag quantity when the real need was relevant, personalized discovery.

### **Actions**

Repositioned Visual Search as **Phase 1 of a strategic transition**, not a standalone feature, partnering across Content, Search, ML, and Product teams.

- Deployed Visual Search in the **upload flow** (not search/browse) to reduce creator friction first, preventing direct competition with existing tag CTR.
- Established **guardrail metrics** with the Content team: maintain tag CTR within acceptable range, measure upload completion rate, and track visual search adoption.
- Framed the initiative as a **3-phase roadmap**: Phase 1 (creator friction removal) → Phase 2 (personalized tag display) → Phase 3 (visual search-centric discovery).

### **Results**

**Phase 1 Launch:**
Upload completion rate increased significantly, directly reducing creator friction.
Content uploads grew, expanding discoverable inventory without sacrificing tag CTR (maintained within guardrail).

**Phase 2 Validation:**
While full personalization required further ML investment, we tested a proxy approach: reducing tag count to only **high-signal products** (most purchased, most saved, best-selling) while running Visual Search in parallel.
Results validated the core hypothesis—**fewer, smarter tags performed better**: GMV increased despite reduced tag volume, and guardrail metrics remained stable.
This proved that "tag quantity ≠ discovery quality" and secured organizational commitment to invest in true personalization and expand reduced-tag approach to other surfaces.

**Organizational Impact:**
Shifted Ohouse's product philosophy from "maximize tag impressions" to "maximize discovery confidence."
Established a validated roadmap for personalization investment and cross-surface tag reduction.
Search and Recommendation teams integrated Visual Search learnings into their own strategies.

### **Reflection**

Visual Search demonstrated that **strategic framing unlocks organizational investment**.

The challenge wasn't designing the feature—it was aligning teams with competing KPIs around a long-term vision.
By positioning the launch as Phase 1 and co-creating guardrail metrics with stakeholders, I transformed resistance into collaboration.

More importantly, it established a repeatable pattern:
**When introducing transformative technology, protect existing value while building toward the future.**
This approach became a template for other AI-driven initiatives, showing how design leadership can navigate short-term business pressure without sacrificing strategic vision.
