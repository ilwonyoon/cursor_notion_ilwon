Visual Search 대화 내용 정리 
“Good for the brand to point out, because the more we talk about it, we're going to deviate from where we are, and then I'm going to talk about the image search. So basically, it's the same feature as the Google Lens. You can try to find the product within the photos, and I'm just giving you the context. So O-House is known for the product tag, which is the plus sign on top of the photos, the link out on top of the photos, and when you tap on those product tags, you can reroute it, redirect it to the product detail pages within the O-House. You can find a product pretty easily. But at the same time, the product tags are noisy, and product tag also doesn't cover every product single detail inside of the photos, because there might be a hundred of them inside of the photos, and we cannot have the product tags of a hundred. So to solve the problem, we invest on the image search, where people can drag and pinch and find the product they wanted to buy, and that's the problem we try to solve. So it's not only about discovering the product, I mean, which is already have the value. This is a long-term project that we eventually wanted to have to deliver the confidence that whatever product you're looking for in the photos, other than product tags, you're going to find a product that you can buy right away. And that's the context. And the other thing is, the challenge is where we're going to put it, where we wanted to put it in the first place. We wanted to put it into the search, do we wanted to put it into the content detail page, do we wanted to put it into the product detail page? Because if you are in the product detail page, you're likely to focus on the product you're interested in, and you're very less much about, you're very less much about, you're not really going to focus on the products, you're not going to, so that's why we wanted to find the really biggest opportunity that drive up the core metrics. I mean, this is something we've got to figure out beforehand, but anyway, this is the context. The challenge is that, what's the right context for user flows that we wanted to introduce this one? So it's not, it's additive, it's not interoperable.”

“I wanted to talk, I mean, I don't think that I was concluding well enough. You are as well. So, my question to the project in reality is that, is it going to really drive the impact unless we're going to change the, replace the product tags? Mainly because product tags are visible. Therefore, people are going to click on them. At the same time, image search is like the keeping behind. So, this is more of the, before just putting it as additive feature, it's not going to drive the core metrics. This is more of the transition feature and how we're going to let people to build a confidence on whatever you're looking at, you're going to discover the product. And at the same time, this is more of a strategic move that we're going to slowly reduce the number of the product tags and also personalize for what they're looking for, rather than just like putting, like put the noise product tags into the experience.”

“Problem of our work is that because the product tag is where people discover actual products, they try to add more and more. So let's say in the one photos, we have the maximum of the 20 product tags. And what's really blocking the view of the photos, which is not really great UX. At the same time, it's good for the business metrics, but at the same time, first, it's not really focused, and also it's not personalized, and also it takes a lot of effort for users. So that's why we wanted to have this one. So this is not only solving for the high-quality content consumption and product discovery experiences, and also tackling on how people emerge. Because this is where people have the... People felt very disappointed about the photos, because you need to add a product text. That's how you're going to get the attention from the users. Therefore, we're going to have the limited number of the content, because people are not... People are reluctant to put more product tags, while their content is pretty strong. So this is not only about editing features. This is more about fundamental, the strategic things about discovering product, and also content creation strategy.”

You said:
“So, for the impact of the, what could be the KPI for this one? So, I'll say this is more of the guardrail that people still discover products from the contents, and we wanted to keep the number as equal to as possible so we can slowly transition into the less product text, but more confidence about discovering. So, that's gonna be measured on the content to the product detail page conversion. And number of the people using the research features. And also we wanted to, so, and also I wanted to have the number of the contents uploaded shifting more. So, I wanted to make that up the numbers.”

“Bye.”

You said:
“So, I don't want to finger code it too much, but let's say we have the bigger lift on the content on both sides, and we are in the middle of kind of fully transitioning to the product tags page. No, no, no, no, no, the product discovery rate, it's lower than what we expected, because it's going to take the time, but this is like a little higher than DarkRail metrics. So, we're still working on it, and also it's totally changed. This takes time, just like Reels, they're overruling the Instagram now, we're totally shifting our people's business.”

You said:
“So I forgot about the user problem. So the problem for the user is that we're, so what we know from the data is that the more detached we have it, people are likely to click on it. But at the same time, when we hear about the user perspective, they're gonna, it's really cumbersome to kind of tap on it, go to the bottom page and come back to the bottom, the content detail page. So the problem is we're not having enough numbers of product tags. The problem is we don't know what product tags that are likely associated with their interests. Therefore, we just ended up adding, adding, adding product tags. So this is the problem of the business that we're only targeting for the business metrics, but at the same time, user experience are getting ruined.”

You said:
“If you're surprised and if you're recapping this experience, so how would you do it?”
00:05
You said:
“Oh, you're missing out the KPIs, the impact.”
00:04
You said:
“So eventually what I wanted is build the confidence for the people's product discovery, whether there is a tag or not. And also we wanted to use the tag for this is something that we need to really tap on it. So it's a more personalized tag while it looks the same. Maybe we can try to rebrand with a more personalized tag.”

“If you're titling this project, what would you say? I don't want to say you need to say anything.”
00:04
You said:
“What would you pick?”
00:01
You said:
“At least you're adding the subtitle to make sure, because this is just not really what it is.”
00:06
You said:
“I may rewrite multiple versions of it, so I get back to it.”
00:03
You said:
“I think I got a too strong showcase of what I did, and oh, I forgot about what I did with the search and recommendation. Not many of the people noticed this as a problem because this doesn't, I mean, the businesses are good.”
00:18
You said:
“This is not the IGL.”
00:03
You said:
“And also I wanted to talk about what could be the risk for keeping this way, just adding the product text and keeping the same discovery model. I don't think that it's up to trend that like introducing as many products as many possible. It's more about personalization and everybody discover products from the easily. Introducing the more number of steps. But I wanted to have the really comfort risk of just skipping this model. Otherwise, and also the benefit is the content generation could be a lot easier. And this is gonna be the strengths of it.”

You said:
“Sounds like a very critical challenge.”

You said:
“I mean, no, no, no, I want it to be.”

“Lesson Search Recommendation works working on the Visual Search, and I've been insisting that this is not, this is previous for a while, and I've, I discovered this opportunity as this is a great way to, because business doesn't see it as problem. I mean, they know it, but they don't know how to solve it, and with this Visual Search, along with Visual Search, we can slowly transition into the plan. So, this is something I did.”
00:34
You said:
“This is something I was kind of shifting the strategy of the visual search, rather than just introducing the technology that is just added to the product tags, but this is more of the fundamental product strategy shift.”

“What if you're weaving all the stories at the last moments into the one single strong narrative for this project?”
