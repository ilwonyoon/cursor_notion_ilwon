# MEMORY - Ilwon's Design Leadership & AI Thinking

## Core Principles (모든 작업의 기초)
**System-level thinking over quick fixes.** Partial changes create more debt than progress. Leaders must do the work themselves first before directing teams. Capability and knowledge distribute through infrastructure, not headcount scaling. Always understand customer/user reality and organizational conditions before redesigning anything.

## Knowledge Map: Projects & Insights

### Portfolio (Case Studies)

**Brand_2.0** (v4)
Persona clarity is the linchpin for cross-functional alignment and decision-making. When you identify and unify around "who we're solving for," brand strategy, team priorities, and execution naturally align. Brands want differentiated treatment; designing for specific users unlocks that. This taught me that strategic alignment before execution beats brilliant execution without context.

**Ohouse_AI** (v8: Agentic Reasoning with Intent Parsing)
Recognized deeper user problem beyond transaction. Strategic pivot: buying products ≠ solving cohesive room design. Got C-level buy-in for data infrastructure investment. Transitioned from managing full design team to IC-level AI product design leadership. One designer empowered with right AI infrastructure achieves outcomes that previously required full team. System architecture enables force multiplication.

**Recent Development - Intent Analyzing Layer (Step 0):**
Added explicit intent classification & clarification to agentic reasoning flow. Handles unclear/vague user inputs gracefully with non-judgmental clarification before proceeding to 6-step reasoning analysis. Connects to n8n Master Designer agent architecture that classifies task types and routes to specialized teams. Makes invisible AI intelligence visible to users.

**Portfolio Structure (For Hiring @ Tier 0/1):**

This is a **2-Part Leadership Case Study**:
- **Part 1: What Experience I Pitched** (user experience + estimated impact)
- **Part 2: How I Got There** (strategic rationale + C-level challenges + Q&A prep)

**Part 1 is structured as 3 vision tiers:**

1. **Near-term Vision: Onboarding + Integration with Existing Ohouse KR**
   - Core thesis: Room photo + AI = Personalized commerce (not another e-commerce onboarding)
   - Key shift: "Consumption → Conversion" to "Creation → Conversion"
   - User journey: Upload photo → Structured intent capture → Shopping Home with AI-rendered products → 2D/3D validation
   - Critical insight: Users need confidence before purchase (5k–100k investments)
   - Business signal: ~50% conversion on rendered product suggestions (early evidence)
   - Source: `/Portfolio/Ohouse_AI/01_near_term_vision/Onboarding.md`

2. **Standalone App Vision: Agentic Design for Global Expansion**
   - Core shift: "Perfect my prompt" → "Give clear feedback" (user mental model change)
   - 7 Key Steps: (0) Intent Classification, (1-6) Agentic Reasoning
   - 4 Key Flows: (1) Agentic Reasoning, (2) Review Proposals, (3) Feedback Loop, (4) Voting/Confidence
   - Value Prop: Bounded options + feedback loops > endless feed browsing
   - Business Model: Subscription + affiliate + voting data as training signal
   - Strategic bet: Design assistance as new TAM, not incremental commerce
   - Source: `/Portfolio/Ohouse_AI/02_standalone_app_ref/⭐_standalone_planning.md`

3. **PropTech Extension: B2B Engine & CAC Machine**
   - Offering tools to property evaluators (buying/renting/moving)
   - Competitive advantage: AI agentic design + product match + engagement tracking
   - Funnel strategy: Free play on property sites → Ohouse AI (top-of-funnel CAC)
   - Defensibility: Full ecosystem (content + commerce + contractors) that competitors lack
   - Source: Daily notes + Vision rationale

**Part 2 Strategic Rationale:**
- Vantage point: Room Planner work revealed visualization-to-execution gap
- Core insight: Problem isn't product discovery; it's decision confidence under abundance
- Strategic hypothesis: Shift from request-based (user burden) to feedback-based (user agency)
- Competing approaches rejected & why (feed optimization, 3D planner, etc.)
- CEO challenges: ambition, user validation, Room Planner relationship, revenue uncertainty
- Q&A prep: leadership journey, conviction moments, intellectual honesty
- Source: `/Portfolio/Ohouse_AI/02_standalone_app_ref/⭐_vision_strategy_rationale.md`

**Key Insights for Hiring Evaluation:**
✅ System-level thinking (not incremental feature optimization)
✅ Customer grounding (rooted in actual Room Planner observation)
✅ Competitive thinking (asymmetric moat vs. alternatives)
✅ Conviction under uncertainty (made a call despite pushback)
✅ Team influence (C-level buy-in without direct authority)
✅ Long-term vision (scales beyond core product)
✅ Leadership IC trait (strategic influence + organizational impact)

**Competitive Differentiation vs. Generic AI Design Tools:**
1. **Lifestyle Understanding through Photo Analysis** - Reverse-engineer user's actual living patterns from space choices (furniture longevity, open space preference, storage constraints) rather than asking abstract "what's your style?" questions
2. **Accurate Spatial Scale via Room Planner** - Guarantee true-to-life measurements (not "surprise when it arrives"), eliminating the scale accuracy failure endemic to competitors
3. **Whole-Home Coherence Infrastructure** - Multi-room upload + real product catalog enables color/material consistency across spaces, something competitors structurally cannot match without integrated inventory system

### Work: Thought Leadership & Development

**AI_Native_Team_Building** (v3)
Leaders must immerse themselves in struggle first. When you get stuck, waste time, want to give up—that's when you understand barriers your team faces. Only through shared struggle can you design removal of barriers, not just directive leadership. Organizations become truly AI-native through synchronous system-level transformation, not piecemeal tool adoption. Protected time without performance pressure is structural necessity, not nice-to-have. This applies to any team adopting fundamental change.

- `/Work_Build_ai_native/AI_native_team_building/linkedin_posting/` - LinkedIn 4-part series (Part 1-2 published)

**PD_in_AI** (v1)
Design leadership's fundamental premise shifted. Medium changed from deterministic to probabilistic. Designers can no longer optimize for predictable user states; must design for uncertainty, emergent behavior, AI reasoning gaps. Design systems must be adaptive (not prescriptive). Leaders stuck in old mental models become blockers. Design system management experience: partial upgrades scatter maintenance burden; system-level redesign necessary when medium fundamentally shifts.

**UX_Writing_System** (v1)
One UX writer becomes 100+ users through system design, not burnout. Progression: Assist (Claude Skills) → Automate (UX Writing Archive) → AI-Native (integrated system learning from performance). Strategic not tactical: chose to build internal system over vendor because maintainability/adaptability matter as tone evolves. Phased adoption (strategic selection → proof building → organic scaling) works. Blueprint applies to any discipline: clarify domain → build infrastructure → distribute capability.

### Personal Leadership Philosophy

**Leadership_First_Month_Framework**
Start with customer/product reality, not vision. Do the work yourself to understand constraints. Only after understanding actual conditions design for what's real, then ask "how could this be AI-native?" Leaders gain credibility through hands-on participation, not directive authority. Self-doubt during learning becomes shared empathy with team, not weakness.
