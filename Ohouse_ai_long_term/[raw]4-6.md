Narrative Flow

Open with the personal “mismatched chairs” anecdote to humanize the pain of costly, irreversible decor mistakes and set up the problem.
Transition to broader insight gathered with user research: even diligent shoppers can’t translate catalog-perfect products into cohesive, livable homes.
Position the 3D Room Planner turnaround as proof of demand for spatial confidence—7× DAU in 6 months, ~30% higher purchase conversion, 30% same-day buyers versus 10-day norm.
Vision Gap

Highlight friction: planner helps decisive decorators, but most people still stall before they can compose a full room.
Frame AI as the missing capability that lowers the threshold from “I have a plan” to “I have a guided vision tailored to my space.”
AI Product Pillars

Your Room, First: product-detail visuals render items inside the customer’s actual room automatically, no manual staging.
Contractor Match: interior contractor portfolio shots reimagined in the user’s space to accelerate trust and booking decisions.
Community Co-Create: AI transforms Q&A posts, sketches, or single photos into visual mockups so helpers and askers align quickly.
Search from Your Space: photo-led search recommends and auto-places products, delivering personalized discoveries beyond popularity lists.
Impact Targets

Higher conversion by evaluating items in a faithful digital twin instead of stylized studio shots.
Shorter purchase cycle as spatial validation happens instantly rather than over ~10 days.
Faster contractor onboarding with clearer briefs, better fit signals, and reduced back-and-forth.
Community health uplift via richer, visual exchanges that resolve “lost in translation” threads.
Next Steps

Draft slide titles for each pillar so they read like benefits (e.g., “See Every Product in Your Space Instantly”).
Quantify current baselines for conversion/time-to-purchase/contractor handoff to size deltas for the roadmap slide.
Gather 1–2 user quotes from research to pair with the anecdote and reinforce the repeatable pain point.


----Below is raw conversation ----


“Is it? And the challenge is, I'm going to move on to the next slide. The challenge is, are you just talking about your dream? We actually have the evidence. So, like, from the 2024, while working on these 3C flywheels, I have the other gut feeling. I have collected a lot of other user insight, working with, collaborating with user research. People are not getting to the dream of their house, because buying a good product doesn't equivalent to you have your dream house. Because people make a mistake, no matter how much they investigate. I mean, their chances are high, because if you try to look at the really fancy drawer, that's your, like, dream drawer, you've been envisioning for a long time. I mean, I can give you an example. Over the corona period, because we were stuck in the house, my wife decided to spend a lot of, spent more bucks on the furniture, especially in the kitchen and the chairs. She got the inspiration, had a lot of different chairs, putting along together, create a mix match. And what we ended up having is mismatch. The chairs wasn't comfortable, it doesn't fit my height, and also the style of the colors. I mean, I complained about it, but it's already done. Done is done. We cannot sell those. I complained to my wife, and I got scolded. I got, I got, she got mad. She got mad at me. So, I know that this problem is real.”

“So, I mean, this is all in the hypothesis that we need to make that happen multiple things at multiple times. That's what startup did. And also, I mentioned about we have the evidence that since I was really primarily focusing on... I mean, I'm not good at interviewing. My house is a lot of mismatch. So we try to find a product we love, place in the house, doesn't work alone, not comfortable, just trashed out whenever we move to a new location, and we do it over and over. I mean, we did a moving link in the past, like, more than 10 times. So we're getting more experiences, but we already wasted a lot of money and materials, which is not good for our business. So that's why I was leading the team called 3D Room Planner, which was dying. But I truly believe that this is something that people really need to have it. And from leading the product, I was increasing the DAU seven times in the six months. And most interestingly, we have a lot of purchase conversion, which is higher than the average purchase conversion, the AR, PPU, on the other ProMotion sites, ProMotion pages, we have it probably 30% higher. And most interestingly, out of all sales generated from these 3D Room Planners, 30% of people buy on that day. And we try to talk to the people, why? Why people are buying? And the reason why people buy the product they discover, and I mean, normally, it takes like 10 days on average to decide what product to buy. But by placing the furniture in their digital twins, and figuring out what's the right scope and space, they kind of examine it in a different place. It's kind of similar experience to the year visiting the offline store to see how it feels or not. Obviously, digital twins doesn't alter the sitting experiences or laying down on the bed. But it simulates the similar experience of whether you're testing out the product as much as possible, then people make the purchase decision. And that takes time. And the challenge was, I mean, this is very interesting, but the other challenge is people don't get to pass the placing to the 3D Room Planner, because the 3D Room Planner is really good for the people who know what they wanted to design for. But if someone like me, even though I'm building a product, I mean, I can place 10 different furnitures randomly, but I don't know how to put them together well. That's the main problem. That's why the scale of this generation wasn't big enough. This is where all of the AI comes in handy. The AI version of this comes in handy. And this is how we try to convince the leadership.”

“So that's the kind of the story curve of where things fall apart, where things are put together as a vision. So this is the evidence, and we have the gap to fill it out, which is perfectly suiting for the AI product. And I'm going to move on to the next slide about how it's going to be. So first of all, you remember the talk about how the getting information has been changed in the AI era. AI gives you the information for you. That is tailored to your case, to your questions. Same for DOS.”

“1. From the product detail page, here are images. It's pretty much the whole CD of photos. Looks fancy, because people wanted to sell the product, but the brand wanted to sell the product in the ideal case, which is natural. You see the photo of that furniture, items in your room, your space. It isn't just like the AR product, that you're placing the 3D object into your room, you can place it. That's pretty limited. That's a pretty powerful solution, but it's at the same time at the cost of the limitation. You cannot play with multiple objects. We tested that too, but for this part, the technology is not at the level that you are integrating all the products like this is real. First of all, everything starting from your room, you're placing that product, what we're rendering, into your house in different ways, so you don't have to do anything. You just do what you do. You scrap or save the product. We're envisioning how it's going to look.”

You said:
“This is the second part, so everything starts from you. Your space.”
00:05
You said:
“And also, I mean, there is the other part, if you are...”
00:05
You said:
“So this is the part which can generate the biggest impact. And it's an upgraded version of the stylus shot. And stylus shot is something that people place the rear object in their place. But the reason why people doing the stylus shot is they want it to actually look not non-studio photos in the rear, like the areas with the lightings and the conditions, which is what we can replicate. Here, one. The second, did I mention that we have the interior contractor service? Same logic applies. If you're finding the interior contractors, you'd like the photo of them. You want them to build the interior service. And you can also, now we have the style reference in your room. And you can play with it, whether it's going to fit in or not. So it's saving a lot of time for the interior agent contractor. So basically, that's one part, like interior renovation. You can use the interior agent's portfolio, contractor portfolio, as your reference and see whether it's fitting your space or not. Lastly.”

You said:
“Lastly, the communities. So, people describe words about words, about their problem they're facing, encountering with their face, sometimes with a single photo, sometimes with sketches. There are a lot of people wanting to help in words. So, those imaginations lost their translation. Because words can, you have your vision to help them, but the way the original, the person who asked the question, might not be really clear about what they meant. And...”
00:45
You said:
“So, lastly, the main part, search. And if you look at, if I analyze all the search queries we have it, the majority of time people don't say a sentence, even though what they wanted is the sentence. But for a single photo where you wanted to change, make the changes, and sometimes you don't know the name of the product, you can describe briefly, and sometimes you're missing the product you should buy, and this is where the AI engine comes in handy. So, you upload a photo, you upload a single photo, and we analyze it, we recommend the product, and we try to place it. And this way, you're not just getting the recommendations that are popular around the service, you're getting the personalized recommendations tailored to you.”
01:00
You said:
“So I was talking about four different features. One, the product images starting from your room is one of the title. The second one, find the style reference from the contractor you wanted to get and apply to your room. Let's try to come up with a better title. The third is help. Community Q&A is ever easier than before because of all the visualization and people can help with AI. The third, the fourth, is that product discovery starting from your room. And I want you to rewrite this title as much as possible as a protocol.”

You said:
“Hey there, one more time. You're cutting it off.”
00:02
You said:
“No, no, no, no, no, no, just save it one more time because I wasn't able to hear.”
00:05
You said:
“And with all these features, I wanted to also talk about the key metrics we're going to change. From the first one, obviously, higher conversion rates, because you're going to be examining based on your boom, not on the other boom. And also, the second time is time for purchase. It should be like it is reduced. I don't know how much, what percentage. The further thing is that also, the shorter time for applying the start consulting with the contractor. And also, they have the better signal and also their better visualization when it comes to actual executing on it. So it's more beneficial. It's beneficial for the contractor side as well.”
00:54
You said:
“We'll run like multiple things, multiple things. I mean, let's do it this to you first. What key metrics we're going to increase?”
00:09
You said:
“And for the community, what metrics? I mean, the bit...”
00:04
You said:
“And lastly, for the search, the product discovery, starting from your room.”
