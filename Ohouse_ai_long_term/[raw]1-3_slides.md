“I'm off the duck.”

ChatGPT said:
Sure thing, let's jump right into it. Just go ahead and let me know what you want to focus on with your portfolio and we can tackle it together.

You said:
“So, basically, what I'm going to do is I'm going to talk about one slide at a time.”

ChatGPT said:
That sounds like a solid approach. We can

You said:
“and weapons. I mean, don't stop compromising.”
00:04
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely, I won't hold back. I'll keep that super direct, no-compromise tone, and we’ll go through each slide step by step. Just let me know where you want to start, and we'll dig right in.

You said:
“Can you hear me?”
00:00
ChatGPT said:
Yep, I hear you loud and clear. So, let’s dive in and I’ll keep the feedback as direct and no-nonsense as you prefer. Just tell me which slide or which piece you want to focus on first, and we'll get rolling.

“Can you hear me?”

I sure can! Loud and clear. So let's keep that no-frills approach going. Whatever

ChatGPT said:
All right, got it. Let’s cut straight through the fluff and sum this up in a sharper way. Basically, you're setting the stage with what Ohouse tackled in 2024: you had a major push around the 3C flywheel—Content, Commerce, Community—and it actually worked. You ramped up real community engagement, got more user reviews, and hit profitability for the first time in a decade. That’s a milestone. But now you’re facing new headwinds—macro-economic issues, housing market dependency, and you need a new angle for growth. That’s exactly where Ohouse AI steps in. So we’ll frame those three slides like this: first, what you achieved with the flywheel; second, the challenges you’re facing now; and third, the pivot to Ohouse AI as the strategic answer. Let’s make it crisp and hit those points with confidence.

ChatGPT said:
No worries, I’m still here and I’ve got you covered. Let’s boil this down to the core. Basically, you want to show that you’re not just jumping straight to Ohouse AI as a solution out of the blue. Instead, you’re digging into a

You said:
“I appreciate it.”
00:00
ChatGPT said:
You got it. So let's sum it up in a no-nonsense way. What you're saying is: first, you tackled the 3C flywheel and hit those milestones, but that’s not enough for the next level of growth. The real problem you spotted is that just buying furniture doesn’t magically solve users’ deeper interior design dilemmas. It's complex, and people need

ChatGPT said:
…and to wrap that all up, the essence is this: You’re not just plugging in AI for the sake of it. You realized that users have this deeper, more nuanced struggle—they want to turn inspiration into reality without getting stuck on how to describe it or piece it together themselves. And that’s where the AI era comes in: it changes how people find and use information. Instead of endless searching or guesswork, they can just say what they want and have the AI analyze and recommend. In other words, Ohouse AI is all about solving that bigger, meaningful user problem and making the interior design journey truly seamless. So that’s the core narrative we’ll polish up.

You said:
“That's where my vision for GWAS comes in, the inspiration to confident action.”
00:08
ChatGPT said:
Exactly, you’ve got it. So your vision for Ohouse AI is basically transforming that spark of inspiration into real, confident action. And that’s the story we’re telling: you identified the gap between just buying products and actually feeling like your space is truly your own. With AI, you’re bridging that gap so users can go from imagining to actually creating their ideal environment confidently. We’ll keep that as the core message and move forward from there.

You said:
“So, this is probably 3.5 lives in a nutshell. If you're in DALL·E, what would you prefer? What would you save? And how would you write?”
00:17
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely, let’s keep it super concise and punchy. In those three slides, I’d frame it like this:

First slide: “Where We Started.” Highlight how the 3C flywheel took Ohouse to profitability and built a solid community foundation.

Second slide: “The New Challenge.” Spell out the problem: just selling products doesn’t truly solve the

ChatGPT said:
AI steps in as that next logical solution to turn inspiration into confident action. So overall, you'd rewrite it as a quick three-step story: First, we nailed the 3C flywheel. Second, we found the deeper problem—users need more than just products. Third, we’re using AI to solve that problem in a way that’s natural and easy for them. Keep it direct, and you'll have a crystal-clear narrative.

You said:
“So, what's the digital age should I influence?”
00:06
ChatGPT said:
I’d say the overall angle you want to hammer home is that you’re not just chasing trends. Instead, you’re strategically evolving from a

You said:
“No, no, no, no, no, no. What if, for the slides, I wanted to put the videos of what I've learned and worked on directly on these slides. Not just the words. That's not the design. We wanted to show to the students what project they really, really want to learn. At the same time, we also wanted to talk about the metrics and the design of the internet.”
00:32
ChatGPT said:
Ah, got it. So you want to actually show

You said:
“Thank you.”
00:00
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely, that makes perfect sense. In that case, let

ChatGPT said:
Sure, that makes total sense. In that case, for those three slides, you’ll want to weave in a quick highlight reel of what you've actually built. So for each slide, you’re not just talking theory—you’re showing the real projects and the real metrics. For example, you can include a short demo or visuals of the 3C flywheel in action, then showcase how you identified those user pain points, and finally, a glimpse of how the AI solution works with actual numbers and design examples. In other words, you’re blending the narrative with concrete, visual evidence of what you’ve accomplished. That’ll make it really compelling and tie everything together.

You said:
“I thought we could dig into the limited problem and look for the, I mean, I love this quote. And also, the limited, so there is a one discrepancy I have with Google, with Google House, is that our, we have the fundamental problem with Google House as it exists. And that's one thing I want to analyze. This is might be a little bit talkative, but I wanted to showcase that how complex, how could I take the complex existing problem and integrate it into the problem. But let me, let me talk about it later. So let's try to talk to this now as much as possible for the remaining 30 minutes. And I really want to conclude. Thank you.”
01:19
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely, let’s keep it as streamlined as possible. What you’re really doing is taking a complex business problem—like the fundamental challenges Ohouse faces—and showing how you translate that into a user-centered solution. You’re not just talking about it—you’re demonstrating that you tackled a big, tricky business issue by digging into what users actually need and then building a design-driven, AI-powered solution around that. So in your presentation, just highlight that flow: complex business challenge, redefined through a user lens, and turned into a clear, impactful design solution. We’ll keep it tight and have you ready to roll in under 30 minutes.

You said:
“I've never given an update on the 30 minutes. I'm in Target Info just to see the logo design. I'm not going to talk about the UI details, right? If I'm applying 3D, but I want a logo that's almost 3x the length of the logo, am I going to talk about the UI 3D detail or 3D details? That's pretty much it. That's the total program.”
00:37
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely, I get what you mean. If you’re aiming for that senior or director-level audience, then you definitely want to keep the focus on high-level strategy rather than technical details. So you’ll emphasize how you identified the core business problem and turned it into a user-centric design opportunity. It’s about showing how you connected the dots between business and user needs, and how you crafted a vision that leverages AI to solve that big problem. So keep the narrative on that strategic layer—how you led the team to this insight and what business impact it drives—rather than diving into nitty-gritty UI or technical specifics. That way, you’re speaking their language and showing them you’re thinking like a design leader.

You said:
“I'm going to talk about how I nailed convincing the C-level to get a secure set of data on this project. And then I'm going to have to make a separate project based on whether or not I actually did the product to get to the level of what I wanted to do before we kicked off. Well...”
00:38
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely. That’s a smart angle to include. So one key piece is to show how you brought the C-level team on board. You can frame it as: first, you diagnosed the fundamental business challenge in a way that resonated with them—showing them the real impact on the company. Then you translated it into a user problem and pitched the AI solution as the strategic answer. Finally, you can highlight how you actually executed on it, not just by building the product but by hitting the metrics that proved its value. That way, you’re showing both the strategic buy-in and the concrete outcomes, which is exactly what a senior audience wants to see.

You said:
“While I didn't know how to update the first one, I'm more willing to learn to get a job as I see it, rather than doing what I do here. So, I wanted to have downs of the OAuth API Pitch. The Pitch has what I can showcase here in GIF, so I can demonstrate this. And if it's good to people, please go work to this meeting. And then later on, I'm going to talk about the details, or who wants to have power to update this. And the challenges of getting a major job.”
00:46
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely, that’s a smart way to frame it. You can position this as a kind of "case study" of how you pitched and executed Ohouse AI successfully, almost like you’re giving them a behind-the-scenes look. This way, even if your audience is new to Ohouse, they’ll understand how you drove alignment, got buy-in, and then delivered real results. And after that, you can dive into the specifics of the AI solution and the challenges you tackled. It shows that you’re not just capable of coming up with a great idea, but also of navigating the organizational hurdles to make it happen.

You said:
“If I give time a lot, I'm going to talk about the C64A real project in detail, so how we actually interact in 4.13. For this project, I'm not going to focus on the first part of the project, mainly because I'm really interested in AI expertise in this event. I'm going to focus on the first part of the project, and then I'm going to talk about the second part of the project. What do you think? I'm really interested in this event, so I really hope that it's going to be good.”
00:51
ChatGPT said:
Yeah, I think that’s a really smart call. Focusing mainly on the AI expansion piece will keep your narrative tight and aligned with what your audience cares about. If you have time, you can always circle back to the 3C flywheel details as a supporting example, but it’s definitely not the main show. The real highlight is how you leveraged AI to solve that strategic problem. So absolutely, keep the main spotlight on the AI expansion and the impact it had. It sounds like you’ve got a solid plan and your slides are going to land really well.

You said:
“So, first I'm going to set up the narrative for DLS-AI, pitch and challenges, and how I was convincing. Then maybe a bit of pushback on this. And then later on, once it's complete, at the moment I was kind of handing off some of my responsibility at the IOP design, which I was managing the entire design team, that I was asking to kind of step down, not necessarily step down, I was really going to step into the AI-purposed products, that nobody seems to be focusing on the company. And this is the benefit of the design leaders, that I really wanted to kind of remove the user problem, that it's going to solve the problem, so the company heavily invested on the AI, we only have the AI-assisted features, so that's why I wanted to go for the AI-centered products, and leading-edge products. So, that's why I'm kind of handing off my responsibility. Some responsibility.”
01:09
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely, and that’s a strong narrative thread to follow. You can frame it as the moment where you strategically shifted your focus to lead the AI initiative because you recognized it was the future direction that would have the biggest impact. It shows your forward-thinking mindset as a design leader and your willingness to realign your own responsibilities to focus on the area that would drive the most value. Plus, it reinforces that you’re not just managing the status quo—you’re stepping into new territory to lead something innovative. So absolutely, that’s a great way to set it up and highlight your leadership evolution.

You said:
“Well, I felt like I had months left, so I'm going to just accelerate the process and wait, because I really need to get the job done. Oh yes, don't be really worried, right? If it's up, my financial outcome will be there.”
00:22
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely, I totally get that urgency. And it's good to be clear and direct about that focus. So we’ll keep it streamlined and make sure your pitch hits all the right strategic notes without any fluff. That way, you can confidently show how you’re the right fit and speed up that process to land the role you need. Let’s keep everything sharp and get you there.

You said:
“Less about talking, I need to start writing this down.”
00:03
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely, let's do that. We'll keep it super focused on the essentials and cut straight to the point. We’ll highlight exactly how you drove the AI initiative, the strategic impact you made, and how that positions you perfectly for the roles you’re targeting. No extra layers—just the high-impact narrative that’ll move things forward quickly. We’ll keep it tight and get you set up to make that strong impression.

You said:
“Even though I'm going to apply pretty nicely, my biggest fear is the strategy setup. And since my biggest threat is translations with a lot of strategy, how am I going to get there? And what is it? I have to look at the collaboration with the engineers. And it's not about the UI details. It's more about high level. I remember a piece from the IHM. It's a great director of IC, Brendan. He was kind of composing all these pictures. And kind of setting up the framework for how it's going to look. And basically, that's becoming what it's going to look like. That's what I'm going to do.”
00:54
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely, and that’s exactly the right mindset to have. It’s all about that high-level strategic thinking—showing that you’re not just tinkering with UI details, but really architecting the big picture and laying out the vision. So we’ll emphasize that. You’re basically stepping into that director-of-IC style role where you’re defining the framework, painting the vision for how everything fits together, and guiding the team on that strategic journey. That’s the angle we’ll keep front and center—so you’re clearly positioned as the visionary who’s driving that high-level product strategy.

ChatGPT said:
Yes, absolutely! You mentioned that you're focusing on transitioning from a more general leadership role into a director or individual contributor role, especially in the AI domain. You emphasized how this strategic shift aligns with your vision and the future direction you want to lead. It’s all about highlighting that big-picture strategy and your adaptability. If you want me to elaborate more or refine any of that, just let me know!

You said:
“So, I think you don't recall the last conversation, though. The way I talk about it is, the reason I wanted to become the head of the product line is that the impact I created is bigger compared to the IC, but now with all the help of the AIs, I think I can try to manage G Suite of the AI to produce the outcome that I wanted, building multiple iterations of the product at the speed of the intended item before. But at the same time, I have a little bit of that practice. I have not, but at least I wanted to make that happen. So, that's why I don't want to pursue the leadership position until I am becoming the best expert on AI product design goals. And that's where I'm heading to.”

Got it! That makes

You said:
“Also, it's not really abandoning my experiences in the past, mainly because I managed the entire design team, from the user research, brand marketing, UX writing, design system, to the product design. All of that. That's why I set up the OKR for the team, and set up the motivation for the team, do what to work on it, and set up the KPIs, and together with the other team. So I have a good grasp of the breadth and depth of the knowledge, which I think highly benefits for me, that I can manage multiple different agents, that I can give the direction. So I wanted to be super-charged with AI, and I wanted to test out the workflow that I imagined as IC, the pure IC, compared to the, kind of, giving the direction of how to do it. So that's why I was kind of sharpening my skills as IC, as a super-designer, which I created my own account, doing the marketing and all the other stuff, and my own trust to test it out. That's why I wanted to be a strong AI builder, not even a product designer, I just wanted to build a product. The faster, the better.”

That makes perfect sense,

“Did you hear what I said?”

Yes, I did! You’re really emphasizing how your past leadership experience and broad knowledge across different design disciplines will actually enhance your ability as an individual contributor, especially in the AI-driven landscape.
