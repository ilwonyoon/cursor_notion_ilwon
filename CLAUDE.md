## Directory Structure & Purpose

### `/Design_Leadership_Hiring_Framework.md` (344 lines)
**Canonical reference for portfolio strategy**

Comprehensive framework covering:
- **Helena Seo's Three Pillars:** Storytelling (narrative craft), Balance (breadth of 2-3 projects), Flavor (authentic perspective)
- **What Hiring Managers Actually Look For:** Operational leadership (process/structure), Managerial leadership (talent development), Strategic influence (NOT creative direction)
- **Company-Tier Specific Evaluation Criteria:**
  - Anthropic: AI safety, design + ML experience, chat/multimodal interfaces
  - OpenAI: Research-to-user design bridge, intuitive + responsible + accessible
  - Google: Large-scale org leadership, UX ecosystems, 5+ years team management
  - Meta: Design ops maturity, vendor management, design standards at scale
  - AI Startups: Speed + scrappiness, AI literacy, autonomous shipping
- **Portfolio Narrative Framework:** Problem → Leadership Role & Context → Strategic Decision → Execution & Team Impact → Results & Impact
- **Red Flags to Avoid:**
  - Focusing on creative output over leadership decision-making
  - Missing business metrics or org/culture impact
  - Unclear personal leadership role
  - Vague decision-making process
  - No evidence of team development
- **Role-Level Differences:** Director (org strategy), Sr. Manager (team excellence), Staff IC (thought leadership without authority)
- **Interview Question Prep:** Problem definition, strategic decisions, execution, business impact, culture & leadership

**Use This For:** Structure case studies, validate narrative against company-tier fit, prepare for tough questions

- Three evaluation dimensions: Company tier (Tier 0/1/2), Role level, Leadership type
- Conversational evaluation flow: Understand Context → Provide Targeted Assessment → Interactive Refinement
- Deep evaluation criteria: Storytelling quality, Balance, Flavor (authenticity), Role-level fit, Company-tier alignment, Business impact, Red flags
- Question frameworks for initial context & deep dives
- Feedback structure with strengths, gaps, interview prep, concrete suggestions
- Key principles: Sophistication + Link to leadership, Show thinking, Make implicit explicit, Authenticity > Perfection

### `/Ohouse_ai_long_term/[raw]1-3_slides.md`
**Ohouse AI Pitch - Slides 1-3 with speaker notes (ChatGPT transcript)**

**Narrative Arc:**
1. **Slide 1 - 3C Flywheel Win:** Content-Commerce-Community loops drove first profitability in decade. Foundation for credibility.
2. **Slide 2 - Problem Ceiling:** Buying products ≠ solving cohesive room design. Users face mismatched, uncomfortable spaces despite research. Macro headwinds demand deeper solution.
3. **Slide 3 - Ohouse AI Vision (GWAS):** AI bridges inspiration → confident action. Users upload photos/describe problems; AI generates room plans, renders products in-place, projects contractor portfolios, transforms community Q&A into shared visuals, personalizes product discovery.

**Key Leadership Narrative Elements:**
- Strategic pivot: Recognized deeper user problem beyond transaction
- C-level alignment: Secured buy-in for data infrastructure
- Personal role shift: Moving from managing full design team (user research, brand, UX writing, design system, product design) to IC-level AI product design leadership
- Rationale: AI literacy now enables one designer to produce outcomes that previously required full team
- Scope: Focused on AI expansion, not 3C flywheel details

**Messaging Strategy:** Direct, punchy, data-driven. Focus on business problem → strategic decision → measurable impact. Emphasize director/IC-level strategic thinking, NOT UI implementation details.

### `/Brand_2.0/` (raw_convo.md + 3 version files)
**Brand 2.0 Project - Case Study for Portfolio**

**Situation:**
- Market trend: Users want principle-driven brands, not mass production or no-name products
- Problem: Ohouse positioned as middle-range aesthetically pleasing brands, but users migrating to competitors (29cm) seeking dedicated brand experiences
- Challenge 1: Brands want differentiated treatment, not grouped with copycat brands
- Challenge 2: Opportunity vs. core user base risk - don't want to alienate existing users
- Challenge 3: Source major brands not yet in inventory

**Leadership Narrative:**
- **Critical Success Factor:** User personas - unified cross-functional team around target user, enabled aligned decision-making on brand sourcing
- **Solutions Implemented:** 
  - Dedicated brand spaces (differentiation)
  - Brand homepage + home module (delivering brand principle to customer)
- **Why This Matters for Hiring Managers:** Shows ability to identify that clarifying "who we're solving for" is the linchpin for success and cross-functional alignment
- Emphasizes strategic alignment before execution, not just project completion

**Use This For:** Demonstrate strategic problem-framing, persona-driven decision-making, cross-functional leadership without direct authority

## Evaluation Frameworks

### Helena Seo's Three Pillars (Foundation for All Case Studies)

**1. Storytelling**
- Craft engaging narrative (not product demo or status report)
- Clear arc: Problem → Personal Strategic Decision → Execution → Results → Learning
- Make YOUR leadership choice explicit, not embedded in team narrative

**2. Balance**
- 2-3 different projects showing breadth of experience
- Mix of strategic thinking + execution, vision + delivery
- Show different leadership dimensions

**3. "Flavor of You" (Authenticity)**
- Short personal intro (< 5 mins) - background, unique perspective, values
- Speak to unique cultural background or interests
- Help audience understand your authentic leadership philosophy

### What NOT to Emphasize
- Creative direction (can be delegated)
- UI/visual design quality (not what senior roles care about)
- Status reports or project completion
- Team's work without showing YOUR specific leadership decisions

### What TO Emphasize
- **Operational Leadership:** Creating order from chaos, designing process, managing ambiguity, executing at scale
- **Managerial Leadership:** Hiring, talent development, creating psychological safety, culture impact, retention
- **Strategic Leadership:** Decision-making with incomplete info, moving org, vision-setting, business impact
- **Business Impact:** Quantitative metrics (revenue, growth, retention), link between design decision and outcome, sustained adoption

## Interview Preparation Framework

### Categories Hiring Managers Will Ask About

**1. Problem Definition**
- "Why was this important to solve?"
- "How did you convince the org this was the right priority?"
- "What would have happened if you didn't solve this?"

**2. Strategic Decisions**  
- "What alternatives did you consider?"
- "Who disagreed with you? How did you handle it?"
- "What would you do differently?"

**3. Execution & Team**
- "Tell me about a time someone executed differently than expected"
- "How did you develop people through this?"
- "How would a team member describe your leadership in this situation?"

**4. Business Impact**
- "How do you measure design success?"
- "Explain the link between design decision and business outcome"
- "Did the org continue using this approach after you moved on?"

**5. Company-Specific**
- **Anthropic:** "How would you design for AI safety and transparency?"
- **OpenAI:** "How would you balance research velocity and product polish?"
- **AI Startups:** "How would you build design culture in a 30-person company moving at AI speed?"

## Red Flags to Avoid in Case Studies

1. **Unclear Personal Leadership Role** - Sounds like team work, not leader work
2. **Missing Business Metrics** - Vague success measures or no link to business outcomes
3. **No Team Development Evidence** - Hiring, mentoring, promoting are critical for leadership roles
4. **Abstract Language** - "We did research" not specific enough; explain YOUR reasoning
5. **Misaligned Impact** - Stated impact doesn't match actual scope/scale
6. **No Evidence of Decision-Making Under Ambiguity** - How do you think when info is incomplete?
7. **Focusing on Creative Output** - "I designed this interface" vs. "I led strategy that aligned 5 teams"
