### `/Portfolio/Ohouse_ai_long_term/` — Ohouse AI Long-Term Vision Case Study
**Location:** `ohouse_ai_long_v2.md` (primary working version) + `arhives/new.md` (ChatGPT iteration for structure reference)

**Target:** Tier 1-2 companies, IC with Leadership level

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION FOR ALL WORK ON THIS CASE STUDY:**

When writing/editing Ohouse AI narrative, you MUST follow this principle:

**Shift narrative from "here's what Ohouse did" to "here's what *I* saw, decided, and drove forward"**

1. **Keep the structural format:** Core Summary + Speaker Script (this is Ilwon's working/editing template)
2. **Inject YOUR leadership role, contribution, and decision-making** into both sections — make it crystal clear *you* drove this as Head of Product Design
3. **Infuse your 5 core principles** from `Flavor_of_Me_Prompt.md` throughout:
   - **Customer first, then systems** — Did you diagnose the customer problem before recommending solution?
   - **Do the work before leading it** — Show hands-on participation (Room Planner work gave you vantage point)
   - **System-level thinking** — Did you recognize this needed fundamental redesign, not a feature?
   - **Self-doubt is strength** — Did uncertainty lead to deeper understanding of user struggles?
   - **Long-term thinking** — Are you proposing phased, sustained transformation vs. quick wins?
4. **Make explicit what you did as Head of Product Design:**
   - Your vantage point (Room Planner team + user research)
   - Your diagnosis (visualization gap = core problem, not a feature)
   - Your strategic reframe (system-level opportunity, not product addition)
   - Your C-level pitch (what you told leadership, why they believed you)
   - Your conviction (long-term vision for AI-powered visualization at scale)

**The narrative should read:** "I saw this through Room Planner work. I connected dots others missed. I pitched this to leadership as a system-level opportunity. Here's why it matters."

**NOT:** "Ohouse had this problem, so we need AI."

**Working Files:**
- `ohouse_ai_long_v2.md` — Primary version being built section-by-section (Sections 1-7 framework)
- `arhives/new.md` — ChatGPT iteration showing structural format (Core Summary + Speaker Script pattern)

**Narrative Arc (with leadership focus):**
1. **Foundation:** What's Ohouse + your understanding of user journey
2. **Historical credibility:** 3C Flywheel success + *why you understand the business*
3. **Problem diagnosis:** Why 3C hit ceiling + *what you saw that others didn't*
4. **Opportunity:** Visualization gap + *your strategic reframe*
5. **Solutions:** Concrete product vision for AI-powered visualization
6. **Business Model:** How this unlocks new revenue + long-term defensibility
7. **Leadership confidence:** Why you're confident in this direction

**Key Success Criteria:**
- YOUR strategic thinking is visible in every section
- YOUR 5 core principles show up naturally (not forced)
- YOUR vantage point (Room Planner experience) is explicitly connected to your diagnosis
- YOUR conviction about long-term transformation is clear
- C-level alignment feels earned, not assumed

### `/Brand_2.0/` (raw_convo.md + 3 version files)
**Brand 2.0 Project - Case Study for Portfolio**

**Situation:**
- Market trend: Users want principle-driven brands, not mass production or no-name products
- Problem: Ohouse positioned as middle-range aesthetically pleasing brands, but users migrating to competitors (29cm) seeking dedicated brand experiences
- Challenge 1: Brands want differentiated treatment, not grouped with copycat brands
- Challenge 2: Opportunity vs. core user base risk - don't want to alienate existing users
- Challenge 3: Source major brands not yet in inventory

**Leadership Narrative:**
- **Critical Success Factor:** User personas - unified cross-functional team around target user, enabled aligned decision-making on brand sourcing
- **Solutions Implemented:** 
  - Dedicated brand spaces (differentiation)
  - Brand homepage + home module (delivering brand principle to customer)
- **Why This Matters for Hiring Managers:** Shows ability to identify that clarifying "who we're solving for" is the linchpin for success and cross-functional alignment
- Emphasizes strategic alignment before execution, not just project completion

**Use This For:** Demonstrate strategic problem-framing, persona-driven decision-making, cross-functional leadership without direct authority

## Evaluation Frameworks

### Helena Seo's Three Pillars (Foundation for All Case Studies)

**1. Storytelling**
- Craft engaging narrative (not product demo or status report)
- Clear arc: Problem → Personal Strategic Decision → Execution → Results → Learning
- Make YOUR leadership choice explicit, not embedded in team narrative

**2. Balance**
- 2-3 different projects showing breadth of experience
- Mix of strategic thinking + execution, vision + delivery
- Show different leadership dimensions

**3. "Flavor of You" (Authenticity)**
- Short personal intro (< 5 mins) - background, unique perspective, values
- Speak to unique cultural background or interests
- Help audience understand your authentic leadership philosophy

### What NOT to Emphasize
- Creative direction (can be delegated)
- UI/visual design quality (not what senior roles care about)
- Status reports or project completion
- Team's work without showing YOUR specific leadership decisions

### What TO Emphasize
- **Operational Leadership:** Creating order from chaos, designing process, managing ambiguity, executing at scale
- **Managerial Leadership:** Hiring, talent development, creating psychological safety, culture impact, retention
- **Strategic Leadership:** Decision-making with incomplete info, moving org, vision-setting, business impact
- **Business Impact:** Quantitative metrics (revenue, growth, retention), link between design decision and outcome, sustained adoption

## Interview Preparation Framework

### Categories Hiring Managers Will Ask About

**1. Problem Definition**
- "Why was this important to solve?"
- "How did you convince the org this was the right priority?"
- "What would have happened if you didn't solve this?"

**2. Strategic Decisions**  
- "What alternatives did you consider?"
- "Who disagreed with you? How did you handle it?"
- "What would you do differently?"

**3. Execution & Team**
- "Tell me about a time someone executed differently than expected"
- "How did you develop people through this?"
- "How would a team member describe your leadership in this situation?"

**4. Business Impact**
- "How do you measure design success?"
- "Explain the link between design decision and business outcome"
- "Did the org continue using this approach after you moved on?"

**5. Company-Specific**
- **Anthropic:** "How would you design for AI safety and transparency?"
- **OpenAI:** "How would you balance research velocity and product polish?"
- **AI Startups:** "How would you build design culture in a 30-person company moving at AI speed?"

---

## Red Flags to Avoid in Case Studies

1. **Unclear Personal Leadership Role** - Sounds like team work, not leader work
2. **Missing Business Metrics** - Vague success measures or no link to business outcomes
3. **No Team Development Evidence** - Hiring, mentoring, promoting are critical for leadership roles
4. **Abstract Language** - "We did research" not specific enough; explain YOUR reasoning
5. **Misaligned Impact** - Stated impact doesn't match actual scope/scale
6. **No Evidence of Decision-Making Under Ambiguity** - How do you think when info is incomplete?
7. **Focusing on Creative Output** - "I designed this interface" vs. "I led strategy that aligned 5 teams"

## Working With Claude

### Using MEMORY.md for Context (CRITICAL)
**MEMORY.md is your personal knowledge RAG** - read it at the start of each session for context.

**What it contains:**
- Core principles underlying all your work
- Knowledge map of all projects (Portfolio + Thought Leadership)
- Cross-project insights and connections
- Your leadership philosophy
- Current direction and next actions

**How to use it:**
1. **Session start:** Request me to read MEMORY.md (I'll do this automatically if you mention it)
2. **Need context on a project:** "Check MEMORY for [project name]"
3. **New insight discovered:** "Update MEMORY with [new insight]"
4. **Project version completed:** "Update MEMORY - [Project] now v[n]"

**Why MEMORY matters:**
- Token efficient (~1,100 characters) - loads quickly every session
- Semantic rich - enables RAG across your projects
- Self-referential - projects understand their connections
- Foundation for all work decisions

**Example interactions:**
- "I'm working on AI_Native_Team LinkedIn series - refresh my MEMORY first"
- "Update MEMORY: UX_Writing Medium longform outline done, moving to draft"
- "MEMORY shows PD_in_AI and AI_Native_Team both touch on system thinking - how can I deepen their connection?"

### Dynamic Update Protocol (Prevent Duplicate Insights)
**Purpose:** Avoid writing the same insight twice in different ways across projects. Use MEMORY as the single source of truth.

**When you discover a NEW INSIGHT:**
1. Tell me: "New insight: [insight description]"
2. I will:
   - Read MEMORY.md immediately
   - Check if this insight already exists in another project
   - If it DOES exist:
     - Alert you: "This connects to [Project name] where we discussed [related insight]"
     - Suggest approach: "Should we deepen this angle differently, or explicitly connect the projects?"
   - If it DOESN'T exist:
     - Confirm it's new
     - Update MEMORY.md with the new insight
     - Note which project it came from

**When you're WRITING/EDITING content:**
1. Tell me: "Working on [Project] - [specific section/goal]"
2. I will:
   - Read MEMORY.md first
   - Identify overlapping insights with other projects
   - Flag potential overlaps: "This touches on [concept] from [other projects]. Should we..."
   - Suggest differentiation strategies:
     - Different application angle
     - Deeper exploration
     - Explicit cross-reference
     - Novel combination with other insights

**Example workflow:**
```
You: "I'm writing AI_Native_Team's closing section about leadership philosophy"
Me: [reads MEMORY] "This connects directly to your Leadership_First_Month_Framework.
    Also, Brand_2.0 emphasizes 'understand conditions first' which is similar.
    Should we reference these, or take a completely different angle?"

You: "Reference the framework but differentiate the angle"
Me: [writes section referencing Leadership_Framework, differentiates approach]
[edits MEMORY to note this new connection]
```

**This ensures:**
- ✅ No insight appears twice in the same way
- ✅ Cross-project connections are explicit and intentional
- ✅ MEMORY stays as single source of truth
- ✅ Each project has unique angle/application
- ✅ Your thinking builds on itself rather than repeating

### For Portfolio Refinement
Use the design-portfolio-evaluator Skill (`.claude/design-portfolio-evaluator/SKILL.md`) for interactive feedback on case studies. It will:
1. Ask clarifying questions about target companies/roles
2. Evaluate against Helena Seo's pillars
3. Provide specific feedback with improvements
4. Simulate tough interview questions
5. Suggest company-tier positioning

### Syncing `.claude/` Directory Across Devices
**IMPORTANT:** All files in `.claude/` (skills, commands, settings) must be committed and pushed to GitHub to sync across devices.

**Workflow for any changes in `.claude/`:**
```bash
git add .claude/
git commit -m "Update [description of skill/command change]"
git push
```

**Why this matters:**
- Skills and custom commands are stored locally in `.claude/`
- Without Git sync, changes on one device won't appear on others
- Always treat `.claude/` updates the same as portfolio/case study updates
- Pull on other devices to get the latest skills and settings

### For Case Study Development
Reference `Design_Leadership_Hiring_Framework.md` for structure. Follow the template:
1. **Opening (Problem)** - Opportunity/problem and why it mattered
2. **Your Role & Context** - Specific role, teams led/influenced, org context
3. **Strategic Decision** - What YOU decided (not team), alternatives considered, org alignment
4. **Execution & Team Impact** - How you enabled execution, team development, handling conflicts
5. **Results & Impact** - Quantitative + qualitative, sustainability, learning

- 내가 포트폴리오 작업하다가 항상 디테일한 부분으로 빠지는 경향이 있는데 - 진행할때 가장 핵심인 부분을 작업 중인지 (큰 틀) 디테일을 작업할 때인지 - 리마인드를 할 수 있을까
- 나한테 제일 중요한 프로젝트는 ohouse ai랑 3C Flyhweel 이야 - 3C flywheel은 아직 내용을 추가 안했고, Brand 2.0, visual search 등은 내가 한일의 breadth를 보여주기 위한 장치에 불가함.
