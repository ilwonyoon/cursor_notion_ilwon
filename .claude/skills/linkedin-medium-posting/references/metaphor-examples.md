# Metaphor Examples and Patterns

This document contains proven metaphor patterns from your writing that effectively explain complex design and research concepts.

## Your Signature Metaphors

### 1. The Drunk Person Under the Streetlight
**Source**: "당신은 고객이 말해도 듣질 못한다"

**Original**: "술 취한 사람이 가로등 아래서 열쇠를 찾는 오래된 농담"

**Explains**: How we look where data is easy to measure, not where the truth actually is

**Usage Example**:
"We're like the drunk person searching for keys under the streetlight—not because that's where we dropped them, but because that's where we can see. We analyze what's measurable (funnel metrics, click rates) instead of understanding what actually matters to customers."

### 2. The Alien Anthropologist
**Source**: "당신은 고객이 말해도 듣질 못한다"

**Original**: "대단한 학문을 갖춘 외계인이라 할지라도 인간의 삶을 분석하기는 어려울 겁니다"

**Explains**: How analysis without empathy misses the human reality

**Usage Example**:
"Even the most brilliant alien scientist couldn't understand why humans drag themselves out of bed each morning by analyzing commute patterns. They'd miss that it's love for the family waiting at home that makes the journey worthwhile. That's us when we analyze user behavior without empathy."

### 3. The Supplier's Cage
**Source**: "당신은 고객이 말해도 듣질 못한다"

**Original**: "공급자라는 새장에 갇혀서 고객의 세계를 들여다보지 못하고 있습니다"

**Explains**: Being trapped in provider mindset

**Usage Example**:
"We're trapped in the supplier's cage—asking 'How was your experience with our onboarding flow?' when we should be asking 'What problem were you trying to solve today?'"

### 4. The Raft You Can't Put Down
**Source**: "당신은 고객이 말해도 듣질 못한다"

**Original**: Buddhist parable - "뗏목의 비유"

**Explains**: Holding onto methodologies after they've served their purpose

**Usage Example**:
"We're carrying the raft on our heads after crossing the river. That AB testing framework that got us to product-market fit? It won't get us to the next stage. Sometimes the tool that saved you becomes the weight that slows you down."

### 5. Knowing Constantinople, Not Your Alley
**Source**: "당신은 고객이 말해도 듣질 못한다"

**Original**: "콘스탄티노플이나 베이징이 크기는 잘 알아도 동네 골목길은 잘 모르는"

**Explains**: Knowing market size but not customer pain

**Usage Example**:
"We know the SaaS market is worth $200B but can't name three specific pain points our customers face daily. It's like knowing Constantinople's population but getting lost in your own neighborhood."

### 6. The Closed Window Needing Moonlight
**Source**: "당신은 고객이 말해도 듣질 못한다"

**Original**: Song lyric - "그대의 창문은 열릴 줄 모르니 사랑의 달빛으로 노크를 해야지"

**Explains**: Understanding requires gentle empathy, not force

**Usage Example**:
"Customer hearts don't open by force—you can't pry them open with survey questions. You need to knock with moonlight: gentle curiosity, genuine interest, and patient listening."

### 7. The Funnel That Doesn't Exist
**Source**: "당신은 고객이 말해도 듣질 못한다"

**Explains**: Customers don't experience life as a funnel

**Usage Example**:
"We ask: 'How was the homepage experience? The checkout? The confirmation email?' But customers don't think in funnels. They think: 'Can I afford this? Is this worth my time? What will my spouse say?' We're measuring the wrong journey."

### 8. The Plant Botanist vs. The Native
**Source**: "당신은 고객이 말해도 듣질 못한다"

**Original**: Lévi-Strauss example about botanist asking natives to name useless weeds

**Explains**: Different frameworks create different blind spots

**Usage Example**:
"The Western botanist catalogued every weed; the natives laughed: 'Why name what you can't eat?' Both were right in their context. When we categorize our features by our product roadmap instead of customer goals, we're the botanist missing what actually matters."

## Metaphor Construction Patterns

### Pattern 1: Universal Physical Experiences
- Searching for something in the dark
- Being trapped in a space
- Carrying heavy weight
- Opening/closing doors and windows

- Alien studying humans
- Tourist vs. local
- Inside the cage vs. outside
- Under the streetlight vs. in darkness

### Pattern 3: Tools and Misuse
- Carrying the raft after crossing
- Looking where the light is
- Using wrong measuring stick
- Map vs. territory

### Pattern 4: Cultural/Literary References
- Buddhist parables
- Historical examples (Constantinople)
- Song lyrics
- Folk wisdom

## How to Create New Metaphors

1. **Identify the abstract concept** - What are you trying to explain?
2. **Find the everyday parallel** - What physical, universal experience mirrors this?
3. **Test the limits** - Where does the metaphor break down? (This reveals its power)
4. **Add humble positioning** - "I also made this mistake" or "We're all guilty of this"
5. **Keep it visual** - Can readers picture it?

## Anti-Patterns (Don't Do This)

❌ **Overused tech metaphors**: "It's like building a house" / "It's like a journey"
❌ **Metaphors that require explanation**: If you need to explain the metaphor, it's not working
❌ **Mixed metaphors**: Don't combine unrelated images in one paragraph
❌ **Corporate speak metaphors**: "Moving the needle" / "Synergy" / "North star"

## Context for Effective Use

**When to use metaphors**:
- Explaining abstract design concepts
- Showing what's wrong with conventional thinking
- Making technical concepts accessible
- Bridging different domains (AI + Design)

**When NOT to use metaphors**:
- Giving specific instructions or steps
- Sharing personal stories (let the story speak)
- In headlines (save for the body)
- When being direct is clearer
