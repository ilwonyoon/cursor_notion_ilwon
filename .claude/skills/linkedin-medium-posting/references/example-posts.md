## LinkedIn Post Examples

### Example 1: AI in Product Design (Experience Story)

**Hook**:
Most design teams are building with AI.
Few are building FOR AI.

**Insight**:
Last quarter at Ohouse, we launched an AI-powered interior design consultation feature. We were so focused on training the model and tuning the prompts that we forgot to redesign the actual user flow.

The result? Users got amazing AI-generated room designs, but had no idea what to do next. We built a powerful engine but left the steering wheel off.

Here's what we learned: AI doesn't just change what your product can do—it changes how people need to use it. A feature that takes 30 seconds to load needs different UI patterns than one that's instant. A feature that gives 5 options needs different decision support than one that gives 1.

We had to go back and redesign the entire flow, not just the AI component.

**Takeaway**:
Before you add AI to your product, ask: "How does this change the user's mental model?" The answer will tell you what needs to be redesigned.

### Example 2: Design Leadership (Behind-the-scenes)

**Hook**:
I used to think good design leaders had all the answers.
Then I became one.

**Insight**:
Three weeks into my role as Head of Product Design at Ohouse, my team asked me to choose between two completely different design directions for our core feature. Both made sense. Both had risks. Both designers were passionate about their approach.

I stared at the Figma files for hours, trying to find the "right" answer. It never came.

What saved me wasn't having the answer—it was admitting I didn't. We ran a quick prototype test with 5 users. One direction failed immediately. The other sparked questions we hadn't considered.

The best decision I made that day wasn't picking a direction. It was saying "I don't know—let's find out together."

**Takeaway**:
Design leadership isn't about having all the answers. It's about knowing how to find them.

### Example 3: Career Mentorship (Educational)

**Hook**:
Junior designers often ask me: "Should I specialize or stay generalist?"

Wrong question.

**Insight**:
When I was a junior designer, I tried to be good at everything—UI, UX, research, prototyping, front-end code. I thought being a "full-stack designer" would make me more hirable.

It made me mediocre at everything.

Here's what actually happened: I got really good at prototyping because I enjoyed it. That led to projects where prototyping mattered. Those projects taught me about animation, which led to motion design work. That created a specialty I didn't plan for.

Your specialty finds you—you don't find it. The question isn't "should I specialize?" It's "what am I drawn to when I have free choice?"

**Takeaway**:
For junior designers: Do what energizes you. Your specialty will emerge from your enthusiasm, not from strategic career planning.

## Medium Article Example

### Example: "Why Your User Research Isn't Working (And It's Not Your Methodology)"

**Opening Hook** (150 words):

We've all been there. You run 20 user interviews. You organize the findings into themes. You present beautiful insights to stakeholders. Everyone nods.

Nothing changes.

Last year at Ohouse, our UX research team spent three months studying how customers search for furniture. We found pain points. We documented patterns. We created personas.

The product barely changed. Our conversion rates stayed flat.

The problem wasn't our research methodology. It wasn't the sample size. It wasn't even stakeholder buy-in—everyone agreed our insights were valid.

The problem was simpler and more frustrating: we were answering questions nobody was asking.

**TL;DR at top**:

Research fails not because of bad methodology, but because we're trapped in the supplier's perspective—asking about our features instead of understanding customer problems. The fix: Stop researching your product. Start researching your customer's life.

**Section 1: The Supplier's Cage** (300 words)

[Explain the supplier's cage metaphor]
[Share specific example of asking wrong questions]
[Show the consequence]

**Section 2: What We Measured vs. What Mattered** (350 words)

[Contrast: funnel metrics vs. actual customer goals]
[Use the "drunk under streetlight" metaphor]
[Specific data showing the mismatch]

**Section 3: The Uncomfortable Experiment** (400 words)

[What we tried instead]
[How it felt wrong at first]
[The surprising results]

**Section 4: How to Escape the Cage** (350 words)

[3-4 practical changes we made]
[Specific examples of better questions]
[What this looks like in practice]

**Conclusion** (150 words):

Three months after changing our research approach, we launched a new feature that increased conversion by 23%. Not because we had better insights—but because we were finally studying the right thing.

The hardest part wasn't learning new research methods. It was admitting that all our expertise in research methodology couldn't overcome asking the wrong questions.

If your research isn't leading to impact, the problem probably isn't your skills. It's your perspective. Stop researching your product through your own eyes. Start seeing your customers' world through theirs.

I'm still learning this lesson. Every time I write an interview guide, I catch myself slipping back into product-centric questions. But now I know what to look for: Am I asking about my product, or their problem?

## Voice Comparison

### ❌ Generic LinkedIn Voice

"As design leaders, we must embrace emerging technologies while maintaining user-centricity. By leveraging AI capabilities and fostering a culture of innovation, we can deliver exceptional experiences that drive business value."

### ✅ Your Authentic Voice

"I spent six months 'embracing AI' by reading every article and attending every webinar. My team still had no idea what to build. Turns out, you can't learn to swim by studying water molecules."

---

### ❌ Generic Medium Opening

"In today's rapidly evolving digital landscape, user research has become increasingly important for product success. Organizations must adopt robust methodologies to gather actionable insights."

### ✅ Your Authentic Opening

"We interviewed 50 users. We had beautiful insights. Nothing changed. Here's the uncomfortable truth: your research probably isn't working because you're researching the wrong thing."

## Key Differences

**Generic posts**:
- Use passive voice
- Hide behind "we/they"
- Smooth over failures
- End with vague inspiration
- Could be written by anyone

**Your posts**:
- Use active voice, first person
- Own your experiences ("I failed")
- Show the messy middle
- End with specific actions
- Only you could write this

---

## Final Reminders

1. **One clear point** - If you can't summarize in one sentence, it's not ready
2. **One good metaphor** - More than one risks confusion
3. **One specific story** - Not two, not three. One.
4. **One clear takeaway** - What should they remember tomorrow?

The number one is your friend.
