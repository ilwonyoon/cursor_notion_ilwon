# LinkedIn & Medium Posting for Design Leadership

This skill helps create authentic, engaging content for LinkedIn and Medium that reflects your unique voice as a design leader focused on AI in product design, design leadership practices, and career mentorship.

## Core Voice & Brand

**Your Brand**: Authentic, passionate, learning-oriented leader who shares both wins AND failures

**Communication Style**:
- Conversational, first-person (like Julie Zhuo)
- Uses effective everyday metaphors to make complex concepts accessible
- Specific examples over generalizations
- Balance vulnerability with expertise
- Clear structure with helpful subheads
- Honest about failures as teaching moments

**What You're Known For**: Making complex design leadership concepts accessible through relatable metaphors and authentic storytelling about real challenges and failures.

## Three Content Pillars

### Pillar 1: AI in Product Design
- Practical application of AI in design workflows
- Lessons from building Ohouse AI and AI-powered interior design systems
- Frameworks for evaluating AI features from a design perspective
- Case studies: design decisions influenced by AI capabilities
- How AI changes the design process itself

### Pillar 2: Design Leadership in Practice
- Team building, hiring, critique culture
- Navigating stakeholder relationships in startups
- Scaling design systems and processes
- Real challenges and messy solutions (not just polished wins)
- Managing design teams in AI-native companies

### Pillar 3: Career Mentorship & Growth
- Helping junior designers navigate career transitions
- Portfolio advice and interview preparation
- Practical career development guidance
- Your own career journey and lessons from failures
- Moving from IC to leadership roles

## Target Audience

**Primary**: Design leaders who will hire you (showing thought leadership and expertise)
**Secondary**: Product designers looking to grow (especially juniors seeking mentorship)

## Content Formats

### LinkedIn Posts (300-500 words)

**Structure**: Hook → Insight → Takeaway

**Hook** (1-2 sentences):
- Start with surprising observation or provocative question
- Challenge common assumptions
- Use specific, concrete scenarios

**Insight** (2-3 paragraphs):
- Share ONE specific example or story from your experience
- Include the failure or challenge, not just the solution
- Use metaphors to make concepts accessible
- Keep it real and vulnerable

**Takeaway** (1-2 sentences):
- One actionable insight
- Clear and memorable
- Avoid generic advice

**Example Template**:
```
Most design teams are adding AI features.
Few are redesigning their design process for AI.

[Share specific example from Ohouse AI - what you tried, 
what failed, what worked. Use a metaphor to explain the concept.]

Before adding AI to your product, add AI to your process. 
Here's where to start: [one specific action]
```

### Medium Articles (1500-2500 words)

**Structure**:
1. **Opening Hook** (100-150 words)
   - Compelling story or observation
   - Why this matters now
   
2. **TL;DR / Bottom Line** (50-100 words)
   - Direct answer to the main question
   - Can be at top or very end

3. **Body with Clear Subheads** (1200-2000 words)
   - 3-5 main sections
   - Each section tells part of the story
   - Use metaphors throughout
   - Include specific examples and failures
   - Balance strategic thinking with tactical execution

4. **Conclusion** (150-200 words)
   - Synthesize key lessons
   - One clear takeaway
   - Optional: what you're still learning

**Subhead Guidelines**:
- Short, descriptive, sentence-case
- Make the structure scannable
- Can be questions or statements

## Metaphor Guidelines

See `references/metaphor-examples.md` for your proven metaphor patterns.

**Key Principles**:
- Use familiar, everyday scenarios (drunk person under streetlight, caged bird)
- Borrow from other domains to explain new concepts
- Often have a critical/questioning tone
- Show what's WRONG with current thinking
- Position yourself humbly: "I also made this mistake"

**Strong metaphor patterns**:
- Physical constraints (cage, window, alley)
- Universal experiences (searching for keys, crossing a river)
- Cultural references (Buddhist parables, song lyrics)
- Tools and their misuse (carrying the raft on your head)

## Content Mix Strategy

Rotate between these types:

1. **Experience Stories** (40%)
   - Your unique journey and lessons
   - "How we built an AI design consultation system"
   - "What I learned moving to Head of Product Design"

2. **Educational/Frameworks** (30%)
   - Teach what you know
   - "3-tier architecture for organizing AI agents"
   - "When to use AI in the design process (and when not to)"

3. **Industry Commentary** (20%)
   - Your POV on trends
   - React to AI product launches from design lens
   - Comment on design leadership discussions

4. **Behind-the-scenes** (10%)
   - Process, decision-making
   - "How I approach 1:1s with my design team"
   - Weekly reflections on what you're learning

## Writing Process

1. **Choose a pillar and content type**
2. **Identify the ONE key point** - What's the single insight?
3. **Find the right metaphor** - What everyday scenario explains this?
4. **Tell a specific story** - What actually happened? Include the failure.
5. **Extract the lesson** - What did you learn? What should readers do?
6. **Add structure** - For Medium: clear subheads; For LinkedIn: hook-insight-takeaway

## Style Guidelines

**Do**:
- Write like you're explaining to a colleague over coffee
- Use "I" and "you" naturally
- Share specific numbers, names, details
- Admit when you don't know or failed
- Use short paragraphs (2-4 sentences)
- Bold key insights sparingly

**Don't**:
- Use corporate jargon or buzzwords
- Make claims without examples
- Hide failures or smooth over challenges
- Write in third person or passive voice
- Create listicles for everything
- Over-format with bullets in prose

## Example Posts

See `references/example-posts.md` for full examples demonstrating:
- Effective metaphor usage
- Hook-insight-takeaway structure
- Balance of vulnerability and expertise
- Specific vs. generic language

## Job Search Context

You're transitioning from Ohouse (leaving Dec 2025) to seek US opportunities in AI-native companies. 

**Subtle integration**:
- Reference "what I'm looking for in my next role" occasionally
- Highlight relevant skills: AI product design, team leadership, 0-to-1 building
- Show you understand US tech culture while bringing Korean startup experience
- Never sound desperate; always provide value first

**LinkedIn Profile Optimization**:
- Headline: "Head of Product Design at Ohouse | Building AI-native design teams | Seeking leadership roles in US (AI-focused companies)"
- About: Emphasize AI + design + leadership
- Open to Work: Private mode (visible only to recruiters)
